TEACHING SUGGESTIONS 


In secondary schools, ungraded students of widely different 
training often report to the same class. Teachers may awaken 
new interests in these pupils by dividing them into groups 
according to the last grade attended in the elementary schools 
and then selecting from Applied Mathematics eob Girls the 
work suited to the need of each group. To illustrate: pupils may 
be drilled in the fundamental operations of integers, common 
fractions', and decimal fractions; they may review percentage, 
trades, and commercial problems, and gain a working knowledge 
of algebra and geometry. By following this method, several 
groups may work profitably at the same time on individual 
problems. Since Applied MliTHEMATics fob Girls' has been 
arranged with a gradual increase of difficulty, teachers who 
follow this chronological order will find it e.specially helpful. 

As each new topic is introduced, its objective is given and the 
solution follows, step by step. Because this moded is clearly in 
the student’s mind, all succeeding problems in the given lesson 
may be solved with ease. 

'An examination of the table of contents will show how readily 
the teacher can adapt this textbook to the individual needs of 
her class.

A TALK WITH THE STUDENT 

You have some special gift or talent which you hope to use in 
your chosen vocation, to improve your home life, and to make 
yourself helpful to others. You may be working all day at one 
occupation—designing and cutting garments, drawing pictures, 
keeping accounts, or typing letters; or you may be turning from 
one duty to another in your home—planning the dinner, making 
an apron, a curtain, a cover for the davenport, or just baking a 
cake. Do you realize that most of these occupations involve the 
use of mathematics? 

Have you permitted your mathematical faculties to become 
"rusty” through lack of use? Perhaps you have thought of math¬ 
ematics only as a study. You will enjoy the fun of applying it to 
your daily work. 

Skill in using numbers in the ordinary affairs of life is not as 
difficult to acquire as skill in playing a musical instrument, 
learning the steps of a new donee, or running a race. All you need 
is interest and practice. Form the habit of applying your knowl¬ 
edge of mathematics. 

Don’t let yourself be confused by the special words which are 
used in mathematics. For example, the word integer means simply 
a whole number (not a fraction) and a digit is just one of the 
figures of the number. The number 234 is an integer and 2, 3, 
and 4 are its digits. Whenever you find, in a problem, a word you 
do not understand, use your dictionary. You can’t study any¬ 
thing without a dictionary.

Explanation of the Second Check 

After finding the sum in addition, 

1. Find the sum of the digits in the top line, and add these 
digits until one figure is obtained. 

2. Follow this method until all the crosslines have been added 
so as to obtain a single figure, thus forming a column of single 
figures. 

3. Find the sum of these single digits. 

4. Then add the digits of that sum. This result will be used 
for the final check. 

5. The next step is to add the digits of the sum, or answer, of 
the problem. Continue the addition of these digits until one 
figure is obtained. 

6 . If the result of step 4 is the same ns the result of step C, 
the problem is checked.

Cross Addition 

OBJECTIVE: Cross addition is much used in business. Practice the 
following lessons till you can add horizontally as readily as you can 
add vertically. 

This skill will be valuable to you, especially in keeping records 
of such items as your weekly sales as a clerk in a store and the 
hours and ^^ages of the employees of a business. 

LESSON 6 

Add without writing in a column. Check your answers. 

1. 100 + 75 + 28 + 32 + 67 + 59 = 

2. 21 + 648 + 195 + 16 + 200 + 65 =

LESSON 7 

To check cross addition, find the sum of each line and add 
these sums; then find the sum of the columns and the cross sum 
of the columns. If these two sums are the same, the problem is 
correct.

Checks for Multiplication 


A proof for multiplication is to divide the product by the 
multiplier, and if the quotient is the same as the multiplicand, 
the multipUcation is correct.

Follow the same 

method of checking as used in addition. 


Multiply as usual, and prove as follows: 

1. Add the digits of the multiplicand. 

2. Add these digits until a single figure is obtained. 

3. Add the digits of the multiplier. 

4. Add these digits until a single figure is obtained. 

5. Then multiply the sum found in step 2 by the sum found 
in step 4. 

6. In this example, 6 X 8 = 48. Add the digits of 48: 4 + 8 

= 12. 

7. Add the digits of the last figure obtained which is 12. 
This will give you a single figure: 1 + 2 = 3. 

8. The sum of the digits of the product or answer is 30. 

9. The sum of the digits of 30 is 3. If the answer in step 9 
is the same as in step 7, the problem is checked.

Checks For Division 

FIRST METHOD: 

The checks for division are similar to those for addition and 
multiplication. See page 2, Lesson 1, and page 13, Lesson 13.

EXPLANATION: 

1. The sum of the digits of the divisor is 5. 

2. The sum of the digits of the quotient is 21. 

3. The sum of these digits is 3. 

4. The sum of the digits of the quotient multiplied by the 
sum of the digits of the divisor is 15. 

5. To this product (15) add the remainder (4), which equals 
19. Add the digits of 19 until a final digit is obtained: 1 + 9 = 10. 
1 + 0 = 1 . 

6. Next find the sum of the digits of the dividend which is 28. 

7. The sum of these digits is 10. 

8. The sum of these digits is 1. 

9. When the final sum obtained in step 5, by the process just 
explained, equals the final sum of the dividend digits in step 8, 
the problem checks.

Multiply the quotient by the divisor and 
add the remainder, and if the result equals 
the dividend, the problem checks. 

Students have discovered for them¬ 
selves this second method of checking divi¬ 
sion. It is the more obvious method, but 
it requires more work than the first one. 
Check a number of problems by the first 
method. You will see that all the work can be done mentally 
and that the process is both fast and simple.

divisible by 6. 

A number is divisible by 9 if tlie sum of its digits is divisibk 
by 9. 

EXAMPLE: 

675 . . . 6 + 7 + 5 = 18 -r 9 = 2. Therefore 675 is 
divisible by 9. 

A number is divisible by 4 when its two right-hand digits are 
divisible by 4. 

EXAMPLE: 

476 ... 76 -T- 4 = 19. Therefore 476 is divisible by 4. 

_ A number is divisible by S when its 3 right-hand digits are 
divisible by 8. 

EXAMPLE: 

2120 ... 120 8 = 15. Therefore 2120 is divisible

will work the problems and return them to you for correction. 
Work as accuratdy and quickly as you can. Each one of your 
classmates participates in malting and correcting such a lesson. 

Drill Device for Addition and Multiplication 

LESSON 25 



You may use this device as a game by having a plus (+) sign 
in the center with any given number placed before the sign; then, 
with a pointer see how rapidly you can give the answer by adding ■ 
the given number to any of the numbers in the circle. Change the 
center number and continue. 

The multiplication sign (X) with a number before it can be 
used and the game continued. 

A useful drill in division may be effected by using in the center 
numbers from 12 to about 110 with the divisor sign after the 
number. 

A subtraction drill will be equally effective. Use the same circle 
as for the other processes. Then make a circle with 10, 20, 30, 

etc.. UD to 100 and put a minus sign before the letter in the center.

TABLES OF MEASUREMENTS 


OBJECTIVE: To acquaint you with the common tables of weights 
and measurements and to help you to use them in solving practical 
problems. These tables of weights, measures, time, money, etc., are 
used constantly in business and at home. You will find it necessary to 
refer to them frequently.* 

Linear Measure Square Measure 


12 In. = 1 ft. 12 * or 144 sq. in. = l sq. ft. 

3 ft. = 1 yd, 3* or 9 sq. ft. = l sq. yd. 

16i ft. = 1 rd. I 6 i 2 or 272^ sq. ft. = 1 sq. rd. 

yd. = 1 rd. 5^2 qj. 3 ()x gq _ j 

320 rd. = 1 mi. 320^ or 102,400 sq. rd. = 1 sq. mi. 

5280 ft. = 1 mi. 160 sq. rd. = 1 acre 

A' =1 sq. mi. 

1 sq. mi. = 1 section 

36 sq. mi. =1 township 

Cubic Measures 

Cubical Contents Dry Measure 


12 * or 1728 cu. In. = 1 cu. ft. 1 bu. = 2,150.42 cu. in. 

3* or 27 cu. ft. = 1 cu. yd. 8 bu. = 10 cu. ft. 


Liquid Measure 

231 cu. m. = 1 gaj. 

gal, (7.48 gal.) = 1 cu, ft. 
62| lb. = 1 cu. ft. (water) 

’Additional tables will be louad in AppendU m.

Wood Measure 

16 cu. ft. = 1 cord ft. 
8 cd. ft. = 1 cd. 

128 cu. ft. = 1 cd. 



TABLES OF MEASUREMENTS 


23 


The power of a number is the product of that number used as 
a factor a given number of times, indicated by a small figure or 
exponent at the upper right of the number, thus: 

3* = 3 X 3 = 9; 5® = 5 X SX 5 = 125, 

Linear measure is changed to square and cubie measures in this 
manner, by using the linear table and raising figures to the second 
or third power. 

Memorize the linear-measure table, then develop your own 
tables for square and cubic measures. 

Linear or line measure is used to measure yardage for dress 
materials, drapes, lace, ribbons, caipets, etc. Square measure 
is used to find the square surfaces used in painting, papering, 
varnishing, cement sidewalks, cement floors in basements, 
linoleum, etc. 

Cubic measure is used to flgure the cubical contents for base¬ 
ments, ditches, bins, tanks, etc. 

By understanding this explanation of measurements you may 
make yourself useful in positions where these tables are used. 

You can figure the cost of materials for your home such as 
curtains, drapes, linoleum, painting, varnishing, papering, etc. 
To the cost of materials, add the labor charges and you have an 
estimate of the cost. Many women do this work in their own 
homes and assist their neighbors in such problems. 

Draw a straight line 12 in. long (mark the inches) linear 
measure. Use the 12-in. line and make a square having 12 in. on 
each side. Connect these marks by lines and you have a square 
foot or 12® = 1414 sq. in. in 1 sq. ft. (square measure). 

By following the foregoing suggestions, make a drawing of a 
box having equal sides of 12 in. Imagine the lines which are made 
on all sides connected by lines and you have a cube with all sides 
alike or 12® = 12 X 12 X 12 = 1728 cu. in. in one cubic foot 
(cubic measure). A paper box would illustrate this suggestion.

Chapter III 

COMMON FRACTIONS 


OBJECTIVE: To increase speed and accuracy in the use of the funda¬ 
mental processes (addition, subtradion, multiplication, and division) 
when solving problems containing common fractions. 

In Chapter I you have been dealing mostly with integers, or 
whole numbers, or units. In your daily use of mathematics you will 
meet many problems that involve tlie use of fractions; that is, 
parts of integers. 

The word/raciions comes from a Latin verb which means “to 
break up.” In mathematics, a fraction is one or more of any 
number of equal parts into which a whole number is divided. 

There are two groups of fractions: common fractions and 
decimal fractions. In common fractions, the unit may be divided 
into any given number of parts; e.g., fifths, eighths, etc. In deci¬ 
mal fractions, the parts are tenths or some power of ten.* Chapter 
III deals primarily with common fractions. 


LESSON 32 

The terms of a common fraction are the numerator and the 
denominator. 


ILLUSTRATION: 3 _ _ _ numerator or counter of the parts. 

4 . .. denominator or namer of the parts. 

The numerator is the counter of the parts, and the denominator 
is the namer of the parts. $f means that a dollar has been divided 
into fou r equal parts and three of these parts are used. 

■nmhJrTni™ P^duct obtained when the number is muWpliod by itself any 

number ^ Umes For example, the first newer of ten is ten: the second power of ton“ 10») ft 
10 X 10 = lOOj the third power of ten (Kp) is 10 X10 X 10 = 1,000.

COMMON FRACTIONS 


29 


A proper fraction is one •svrkose value is less than a unit. 
EXAMPLE: I 

An improper fraction is one whose value is greater than a unit, 
or the niunerator is larger than the denominator. 

EXAMPLE: ^ 

A mixed number is an intesger (whole number) and a fraction 
(a part of a number). 

EXAMPLE: 2| 

An improper fraction can be changed to a mixed number by 
dividing the numerator by the denominator: i = 2|. A'mixed 
number may be changed to an improper fraction by multiplying 
the integer by the denominator and adding the numerator: 
= !• 

You can change the denominator without changing the value 
of a fraction if you multiply both the numerator and the de¬ 
nominator by the same number. 

EXAMPLE: Change ^ to sixths. 

SOLUTION: I X I = 4. 

EXAMPLE: Change f to tenths. 

SOLUTION: I X I = A- 


To reduce a common fraction to its lowest terms, divide both 
the numerator and the denominator by the same number until 
the terms of the fraction have no common divisor. 

EXAMPLE: Reduce to lowest terms. 

SOLUTION: = |. 

LESSON 33 

Addition and Subtraction of Common Fractions 

In order to add or subtract common fractions, the denominators 
must be changed to a common denominator (a common name).

that is, a denominator that is divisible by each of the denom¬ 
inators without a remainder. The least common denominator is 
the least number that will contain each of the denominators 
without a remainder; this is obtained by a proces.s of factoring the 
given denominators. Tactor (factors are divi.sors) the given 
denominators as in the illustration. Keep on factoring until all 
the factors are used. The product of these divisors is the Least 
Common Denominator. 

By using (1) as the numerator in the first part of each of the 
following problems and then using the same denominator witli 
different numerators, the work is simplified. The product of the 
factors of a number equals the number.

Chapter IV 

DECIMAL FRACTIONS 


OBJECTIVE: To develop skill, ability, and understanding in working 
with decimal fractions: to increase speed and accuracy in the reading 
and writing of decimals; to understand the principles that underlie the 
changes necessary to convert common fractions to decimal fractions. 
Drill in the four fundamentals—addition, subtraction, multiplication 
and division—of decimal fractions in order to use them in practical 
problems. 

A decimal fraction lias ten or some power of ten for its de¬ 
nominator. The power of a number is the product of a number 
multiplied by itself. This process may be indicated by the use of 
a small figure, called an exponent, placed to the upper right of a 
nu&amp;ber, thus lO^, lO^, which means that 10‘'* = 10 X 10 or 100; 
10® = 10 X 10 X 10 or 1,000, etc. The denominator of a decimal 
fraction is a tenth, or a hundredth, ora thoiusandth, etc. Common 
fractions may be changed to decimal fractions, and decimal 
fractions may be changed to common fractions. This will be 
explained in the following lessons. 

LESSON 50 

To simplify the reduction of common fractions to their decimal 
value, a common fraction may be considered as a form of division, 
the numerator being the dividend, and the denominator the 
divisor. 


ILLUSTRATION: .75 

f changed to decimal value. 3 t 4 or 4)3^0 
Since f is less than an integer, the quotient is less than an 
integer.

3 ^ may be written .1, and is read one tenth. 

tto may be written .01, and is read one hundredth. . 

iiaa may be written .001, and is read one thousandth. 

T tt ’u i nr may be written .0001, and is read one ten thousandth. 
The first place to the right of the decimal point is tenths, the 
second place is hundredths, the third thousandths, etc. 

.0401 is read, four hundred one ten thousandths. 

To aid you in reading decimals, cover the decimal point and 
read the number as an integer and then name the denominator 
which has as many ciphers as there are places to the right of the 
decimal point. To illustrate, .76407 may be written 76407

If there is a decimal in the 
divisor, multiply both .the di¬ 
visor and the dividend by ten, 
or some power of ten. That 
will make the divisor an integer. 
Then divide as in the United 
States money system. The deci¬ 
mal point in the quotient is di¬ 
rectly over the decimal point in 
the dividend. Division of deci¬ 
mals is not difficult after the di¬ 
visor is changed to an integer 
and the dividend changed to 
correspond with the divisor 
change. 


The power of a number is the product of a number multiplied

PERCENTAGE 


OBJECTIVE; To understand percentage; to get acquainted with the 
terms used in percentage; and to learn how to apply percentage to 
everyday problems. 

Percentage is simply so many hundredths of anything. For 
example, 5% of a dollar is of $1.00 or 5 cents; 6% of a ton of 
coal is XM of 2,000 lb. or 120 lb. of coal. 


LESSON 64 

Three terms are used in percentage: base, rate, and per¬ 
centage. The base is the number on which the percentage is com¬ 
puted; it represents the whole or 100%. The rate shows how 
many hundredths-are used. The percentage is the product of the 
base and the rate. 


ILLUSTRATION: 

$625 (base) X 5% (rate) = $31.25 (percentage). 

Thwe are three cases in percentage. To find the percentage 
when the base and rate are given, is one case. 


Rule. Base X rate = percentage. 

Base + percentage = SP (selling price) with a gain, 
ase - percentage = SP (selling price) with a loss. 

EXAMPLE; 


Two solutions arc given to illustrate this case:

1. 25% = (rate) = J (rate). 

? (rate) X $1.76 (base) = $ .44 percentage (gain). 

$1.76 cost + $ .44 percentage = $2.20 (selling price with 
gain). 

If this problem states a per cent as a loss, the steps for working 
are the same except that the loss is subtracted from the cost and 
that would equal the selling price with a loss. 

2. $1.76 cost (base) $1.76 cost

LESSON 66 

In the second case in percentage, the percentage and rate are 
given, and it is necessary to find the base. 

Rule: Percentage -¥■ rate = base. 

EXAMPLE: 

6 is 25% of what number? 6 is the percentage, 25% is the rate. 
Two solutions are given to illustrate this case. 

6 -5- 25% = (6 .25) = (6 -5- tot) = 6 X "A” = 24 the 

base; or 6 -4- 25% = 6 -f- ^ = 6 X t = 24 the base. 

Another statement may aid those of you who are more familiar 
with common fractions. 

6 = 25%; thus 6 = of number. Since i is the whole number, 
4X6 or 24 is the whole number or the base.

Discounis 

OBJECTIVE: To learn how to fiaure the cost of an article when one 
or more discounts are allowed. 

The word discount as it is used in the following several lessons 
means a sum which the seller allows the buyer to deduct from 
the marked price of tlie goods or from the price as stated in the 
bill. Discount is usually figured as a percentage of the stated 
amount or marked price. 

Some dealers allow two or more discounts, called cliain dis- 
cmnts or series discounts. This method of discount is figured as 
follows: Find the discount allowed at the first rate, and subtract, 
that from the cost; then find the discount on the remainder at 
the given rate, and subtract. This is the new cost. Continue this 
method until all the rates of discount are used. Do not add the 
dwcounis and use their sum as the roie 0 /discount

Tariff on Imports 

OBJECTIVE; To give you an understanding of terms used in reference 
to tariff on imports and to apply your knowledge of percentage to 
calculating import duties. 

An import duty is a tax placed by the government upon mer¬ 
chandise from a foreign country which enters into United States 
trade. The rate of duty placed upon one kind of article will not 
be the same as that placed upon another article. For instance, the 
rate of duty placed upon a handkerchief differs from that placed 
upon a tablecloth. All of the different rates are listed in a law 
known as the Tariff Act. 

An ad valorem rate of duty is a tax which requires the payment 
to the government of a certain percentage of the value of the 
merchandise before it is permitted to be placed on sale in the 
United States; a specific rate of duty is a tax which requires the 



PERCENTAGE 


55 


payment to the government of a certain number of cents or 
dollars for eacli unit of quantity (yard, pound, ton, dozen, etc.) 
before it is permitted to be placed on sale in the United States; a 
compound rate of duty is a tax which requires the payment to 
the government of a certain percentage of the value of the 
merchandise and a certain number of cents or dollars for each 
unit of quantity before it is permitted to be placed on sale in the 
United States. 

In the computation of duty on entries, ad valorem rates will be 
applied to the value in even dollars, fractional parts of a dollar 
amounting to less than 50 cents being disregarded, and 50 cents 
or more being considered as $1. If the rate of duty wpoti such 
entries is specific and $1 or less per unit, fractional quantities, if 
less than one half, icill he disregarded, and if one half or more, 
will he treated as a whole unit. If the specific rate is more than $1 
per unit, duty will be assessed upon the exact quantity, and the 
fractional part thereof, if any, expressed in the form of a decimal 
extended to two places. 

Cei'tain merchandise which is not native to the United States 
and, therefore, hard to obtain in this country, such as rubber, 
coffee, crude minerals, etc., is listed on what is known as the 
“Free Schedule” and may enter the United States without duty 
payment. These importations represent about 67% of the United 
States imports. 

A city or town at which duty assessment may be made is 
called a “port of entry.” A port of entry is located at a place 
which will best serve the people of a given district and at the same 
time prevent smuggling; that is, the improper entry of merchan¬ 
dise into the United States. A Collector or Deputy Collector of 
Customs orders the checking and examination of all merchandise 
sent through these ports of entry. The checking and examination 
of the merchandise is done by inspectors, examiners, or other 
customs-service personnel before the merchandise is released to 
be placed on sale. 

Usually an invoice is sent by the shipper showing the value, 
weight, and quantity of the merchandise, the number of packages 
the place of manufacture, the place from which shipped, and other 
required information. When a shipment exceeds $100 in value. 



56 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 

an invoice certified before a United States consul in the foreign 
country (known as a Consular Invoice) is required to be executed 
to show the information listed in the preceding sentence. 

When merchandise is not called for or the duty is not paid, it 
is placed in a bonded warehouse (a warehouse which has given 
bond to secure the United States against loss) for a given period 
of time after which it is sold at public auction. 

Gross weight is the weight of merchandise including the con¬ 
tainer and packing material. Net weight is the weight of mer¬ 
chandise without the container or packing material. Tare is the 
weight of the container and packing material. 

For ordinary purposes, breakage or leakage is allowed when the 
final assessment of duty is made.

and added to the cost, making the selling price more than the 
cost. If an article is sold at a loss, the loss is figured on the cost 
at a given rate and subtracted from the cost, and then the selling 
price is less than the cost.

Simple Interest 

OBJECTIVE: To develop ability to understand the arithmetic neces¬ 
sary to compute interest problems. 

Interest is a premium paid for the use of money and is figured 
on the amount of money borrowed at a given rate per year for 
stated time. The sum borrowed is called the base or principal. 
The interest plus the sum borrowed is called the amount. 

LESSON 88 

Interest -h principal = amount. 

Use 360 days for 1 year; 30 days for a month. 

EXAMPLE: 

Find the interest on $420 for 1 yr., 2 mo., 16 days at 6%. The 
cancellation method used in this solution is easily understood. 
Change the time to days and use as a part of a year. 

SOLUTION: 

$420 (base) X tSt (rate) X (time) = $30.45 interest 
(percentage).

Compound Interest 

OBJECTIVE: To learn how to compute compound interest. 

Compound interest is figured on'the amount borrowed at the 
close of a one-year, a six-month, or a three-month period. The 
interest for the first period is added to the principal and that 
sum or amount is used as the new principal; then the interest for 
the second period is figured on the new principal and it is again 
added to the last amount making another new principal, and so 
on. If the third decimal place is 6 or more, add 1 to the second 
(iecimal place, 

LESSON 94 

EXAMPLE: 

Find the compound interest on $6,000 for 2 yr., 6 mo., at 6%. 
Compound interest, when figured for 6 months, 4 months, or 

3 months, is or J of the per cent of interest for one year. 
SOLUTION: 

$6,000 X .025 (2^%) = $160 . . . interest for first 6 months. 
$6,000 + $150 = $6,150 .. . amount for first 6 months. 

$6,150 X .025 = $153.75 . . . interest for second 6 months.

Exact Interest 

Exact interest is computed for the exact time in days between 
the date on which money is borrowed until and including the date 
that it is due, but not including the date on which it is borrowed. 
The principal times the rate, times the exact number of daysi 
divided by 886 equals the exact interest. Note that for exact 
interest we figure 365 days to the year. To find the exact number 
ot days between dates, refer to page 73, Lesson 97.

Common Fractions, Decimals, Percentage 

OBJECTIVE: To review the steps necessary to change common 
fractions to decimal fractions, to the United States money system, and 
to percentage. 

The processes of changing common fractions to their decimal 
value and to their value in the United States money system and 
then to their percentage value are useful for solving many 
problems. 


LESSON 96 

The following illustrations are arranged to show how decimals, 
percentage, and United States money are closely related, and how 
changing from one to the other follows in logical sequence. 

After you have studied these subjects separately many of you 
may not realize how closely they are related. A study of these 
illustrations will aid you in making similar changes when they are 
needed in problems.

PAy ROLLS AND TIME SHEETS 


OBJECTIVE: To l«arn how to read punch cards and to compute time 
sheets, deductions for Social Security, overtime, pay checks, etc. 
Vou will hnd a working knowledge of these processes always useful 
In figuring your own time and wages, and it may help you to secure a 
position where you must do this figuring for your firm. 


Pay rolls and time sheets are daily, weddy, or monthly state¬ 
ments on which accurate records are kept, showing the time and 
the services rendered by each employee of a company. These 
records are compiled from punch cards used with an automatic 
electric clock by means of which time, overtime, or piecework is 
recorded. Pay rolls and time sheets are frequently separate. 

If you work for a firm where punch cards are used, your name 
will appear on a card together with a clock number, days of the 
week, space for filling in the hours worked. These cards are kept 
in certain assigned places, and when you enter the building you 
hold your card in the clock which electrically punches the time 
when you entered the building to begin work. You use the same 
procedure when you leave your work. This gives your employer a 
correct record of the days, hours, and minutes that you were at 
work.

8 mo. + 1 yr. or 12 mo. = 20 mo. 

20 mo. — 1 mo. = 19 mo. 

7 days + 1 mo. or 30 days = 37 days. 

■ Subtract 1 yr. (12 mo.) from 1937 to add to the 8 mo. because 
it is not possible to subtract a larger number (11 mo.) from a 
smaller number (8 mo.). 1 mo. or 30 days must be subtracted 
from 20 mo. to add-to 7 days because it is not possible to subtract

How a Day Is Gained in Leap Year 

To be exact, there are 365 days, 5 hr., 48 min., 49.7 sec. in one 
year. Thus, in four years approximately one day is gained. How 
much is gained exactly? How many minutes and seconds too 
much is added in a leap year? 


Leap Year 

Each year that is divisible by four without a remainder is a 
leap year, excepting the years which end a full century, which, to 
be a leap year, must be divisible by four hundred without a 
remainder. The years 1900 and 1800 were not leap years, but 
1600 was a leap year and 2000 will be a leap year. 

This dropping of leap years at some of the century years 
compensates, again approximately, for the excess minutes and 
seconds added in the leap years.

Arabic and Roman Numerals 

OBJECTIVE: To familiarize yourself with the two systems of numerals 
used and to practice reading and changing from one system to the 
other. 

Arabic numerals or figures, consisting of 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 
and 9, were first used in India, and in the early part of tL ninth 
century were introduced to Europe by the Arabs. 

Roman numerals originated from arbitrary signs which later 
were formed into letters most nearly resembling these signs. They 
are upright or erect to distinpisH them from the italic or slant 
characters, and are expressed in letters such as L, IV, I, etc. They 
are, frequently used on clock dials, for dates on cornerstones of 
buildings, to head chapters in books, for dates on college and uni¬ 
versity diplomas, etc.

Chapter VII 
GRAPHS 


OBJECTIVE: To learn lo read grapha, to understand their meaning, 
and to use them in solving problems. Graphs are so commonly used 
that they may be considered almost a part of our language. 

Statements of related facts, when expressed in words, are 
difficult to understand, but when these same facts are compared 
by means of graphs you see at a glance just what the words did 
not express to you. Graphs then are used to express related 
facts. Pictographs, bar, line, broken-line, and circle graphs are in 
common use. 

Circle graphs are used for budget making for the family 
finances, or are used as a dollar representing the expenses and the 
costs, usually given in percentage, of vaiious departments of the 
government, etc. 



This is one type of bar pmph, showing a comparison, in percentages, 
of automobile-accident fatalities by the days of the week 

82 



















GRAPHS 


83 


Line graphs may be straight, curved, or broken, and are used to 
compare magnitude and importance of events for various periods 
of time, variation in costs of commodities, etc. 

Bar graphs may be either vertical or horizontal. They are used 
for unrelated comparisons or those less closely related.

. LESSON 116 

Note: When 13 in., 17 in., or 19 in. of material ia given in a 
problem, unless the material is expensive, it is correct to use the 
nearest aliquot part of a yard. For example: 13 in. may be con¬ 
sidered as 12 in. or ^ yd., 17 in. as 18 in. or i yd., 23 in. as 22^ in. 
or I yd. 

When material is expensive, this method of figuring -would not 
be advisable. In examples 4 and 5, by taking 13 in. as ^ yd. 
instead of there is a difference of half a cent, and it is often 
found that an amount gained in one place is lost in another, 
and the small differences balance accounts.

Making Gauges 

OBJECTIVE: To train yourself for accuracy when working with parts 
of an inch. 

LESSON 117 

To make a seam and hem gauge, bring a tape measure 
and scissors to dass. Mark off on a piece of paper, 1 by 3 
in., the following: | in., | in., | in., ^ in., | in., fin., f in., 
1 in., and 2 in. From the upper corners mark in on a 



SEWING PROBLEMS 


95 


straight line and draw a slant line down; 
from the lower corners, mark in on a 
straight line and draw the slant line up. 
The distance from the corner to the 
straight line is the measure used. After 
practicing on paper, use a stronger 
material, such as pressboard- or stiff 
cardboard, to make gauges used in 
sewing classes. The measurements must 
be very accurate, or the gauge is of no 
value to the pupil. Cut out as indicated 
in the drawing. It is necessary for the 
instructor to examine the gauge before 
permitting its use. 

Abstract and Concrete Problems 

Numbers are classified as abstract, 

concrete, or denominate. Abstract num* 

hers are not applied to any particular 
A seam and hem gauge ( 3 )^ 

, Concrete numbers are used in word problems and are applied 
to some name in the problem as f yd., 3 books, 4 boxes, etc. 

Denominate numbers are units of some table of measure as 3 
quarts, 5 miles, 4 inches, etc. 

Abstract problems have the signs which indicate or show the 
various steps or operations necessary to solve the problem, as 
7X8-6 h-5 = 10. 

Concrete problems use no signs to give the correct operations, 
but pupils must be able to interpret the words of the problem in 
such a way as to use the correct sign in the solution of the prob¬ 
lem. 

EXAMPLE: 

A bookstore allows a clerk in the store a 15% discount on books 
bought. Find the cost, the discount, and the amount that the 
clerk will pay for 3 books at $1.76 each. 




96 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 


SOLUTION! 

$1.75 X 3 = $5.25 cost of books. $5.25 X ^ discount = 

$ .79. $5.25 - $ .79 = $4.46 dost for the clerk. 

Interpretation of Concrete Problems 

OBJEGIVE: To overcome difficulties met in reading and working 
concrete or word problems such as you must solve in daily life. 

Every problem in arithmetic is solved by using one or more of 
the fundamental operations; that is, addition, subtraction, multi¬ 
plication, or division. To solve abstract examples, when these 
operations are indicated by the correct signs, is not difficult, but 
often it.is not easy to select the correct process from the wording 
in concrete or word problems. It is worth while to spend some 
time on the interpretation of a problem in order to choose the 
correct procedure. Follow these suggestions when working a set 
of problems, and pick out key word for each problem. 

(Do oot wkprobbm, bu^usc koy mitdafot Answers instead of arltliiootioiil answers.) 

LESSON 118 

How to attack a problem.'. 

1. Read the problem several times. 

2. What facts are given? 

3. What process is used and what is its sign? 

4. What is the question asked? 

5. What is the estimated result? 

6 . Do the results check according to the conditions of the 
problem? 

The following arithmetical shorthand symbols are used to indi¬ 
cate the four fundamental operations, whether in integers, 
fractions, decimals, or percentage. Look for the word that 
indicates the correct operation; this word is the key to the solu¬ 
tion of the problem. Look for the key word. 

The following words are used to indicate the four fundamentals 
used in problems: 

Addition add, added to, credit, increase, increased by, 
more or more than, plus, sum, total, whole. 

Subtraction — balance, cut, deduct, decrease,'debit, differ¬ 
ence, from, less, less than, loss, minus, remain, take from.

Division divided, distributed equally, equai shares, 

when a certain per cent of a number is given to find the whole, to 
find the average, to find a quotient. 

Some confusion is caused by the use of a variety of forms to 
obtain the same answers. For example: 3)12; 12 3 = 4; ^ of 

12 = 4; and ^ X 12 = 4; Y = 4. 

, Constant drill in the use of these arithmetical symbols is very 
valuable, Reading is to arithmetic what reading is to English; in 
both cases better understanding is acquired and both subjects 
become more interesting.

LESSON 120 


General Relb: For hems of | in. or more, | in. is allowed for 
the first turn of the hem, and for narrower hems ^ in. is allowed- 
i in. is allowed for the top seam, varying with the quality of 
material, and when tucks are made, twice the depth of a tuck is 
used. Therefore, if a flounce when finished is to be 5 in., add to the 
S in. all that which is taken up in inch, hems, turns, and seams.

Ruffling Problems 

OBJECTIVE; To find the yardage needed for a ruffle for a dress, a 
valance for a bedspread, or a flounce for a chair, after finding the 
width of the ruffle. 

The tucking and hemming problems in Lessons 120 and 121 
gave the steps necessary to find the width of material to be used 
for flounces. The followmg problems are to find the yardage for 
ruffles. 

LESSON 122 

General Rule: For ordinary ruffling allow 1^ times the 
straight edge for fullness. When less fullness is desired, 1| or Ij 
times the straight edge may be allowed. The amount of fullness 
required depends upon the garment and upon the quality of the 
material used. 

EXAMPLE; 

How much material is required to make a ruffle for a skirt 
which measures 3 yd. around the bottom, if the ruffle is 6 in. deep 
and the material is 27 in. or | yd. wide? Allow 1 ^ times for full¬ 
ness. 

SOLUTION: 

3 yd. (straight edge), X I 5 (fullness) = 4| yd. (length of 
ruffle). 4^ yd. 4- f (width of material) = 6 times; hence, 6 widths 
or strips. 6 in. (width of the ruffle) X 6 (strips) = 36 in. or 1 yd. 
of material is needed to make a 6 -in. ruffle for a skirt measuring 
3 yd, around the bottom with material 27 in. wide. A fraction of 
a width is counted as a whole width. 

The yardage for lamp-shade material is found in the same way. 
The measurement of the lower edge of the shade, times the 
allowance for the fullness, divided by the width of the material, 
times the height of the lamp shade, equals the required yardage. 

1. Find the amount of material required to make 3^ yd. of 
ruffling, 9 in. deep, from material which is 24 in. wide. 

2. If a piece of material is 36 in. wide, find the amount of

Smocking Problems 

OBJECTIVE: To figure the amount of material used in smocking. 
lesson 123 

The general rule for'smocking is to allow three times the width 
of the design, but when less fullness is desired, twice the width of 
the design is allowed. If the design is to be 2 in. wide, 6 in. of 
the material is used. 

1. How many inches of material are used to make a 3-in.

Belt Pioblems 

OBJECTIVE: To train for accuracy when making belts which require 
exact measurements as to width and length. Belts are used for bloom¬ 
ers, slacks, skirts, etc. 

LESSON 125 

EXAMPLE; 

Find the length of a belt for children’s bloomers, if the waist 
measure is 26 in., and the belt is If in. wide when finished. Either 
the front or the back belt must be made longer, to allow for 
lapping. 

SOLUTION: 

Divide the entire belt by 2 and to one half add 1^ in. for lap or 
placket and ^ in. for turning in; to the other half add ^ in. for 
turning in. 

26 in. + 2 = 13 in. 

13 in. -|- If in. (for placlcet) -j- f in. (turned in) = 15 in. for the 
longer belt. 

13 in. -{- § in. (turning in) = 13§ in., for the shorter belt. 

15 in. -|- 13^ in. = 28^ in., entire length of belt. 

The above will vary if the placket is to be wider or narrower 
than I in. 



APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 


104 

EXAMPLE: 

Find the -width of the belt, if, when finished, it is to be in. 
wide. 

SOLUTION: 

Multiply in. by 2, add i in. for turning in, to find the entire 
width of the belt before making. 

li in. X 2 + § in. = 3 in., width of belt. 

Therefore, the belt, when cut, will be 28j in. long and 3 in. wide.

Pleating Problems 

OBJECTIVE: To learn to figure the amount of material needed to 
make pleats. 

Material must be cut three times the width of a pleat to make 
a single pleat; a box pleat requires twice as much as a single pleat, 
and a double box pleat twice as much as a box pleat. From 
material or paper make single pleats, box pleats, and double box 
pleats for illustration. 

LESSON 127 
EXAMPLE: 

How much material is required to make a single pleat 2 in. 
wide?

Bias Problems 

OBJECTIVE; To learn to compute yardage used when cloth is cut bias. 

Milliners and dressmakers use material cut on the bias for 
folds, cords, binding, facing, and trimming. A bias strip is about 
IJ times the width of the material; that is, material 24 in. wide 
will have a true bias of X 24 in. = 32 in. 

Knd the yards or parts of a yard used to make a given number 
of yards of bias. 

LESSON 128 

EXAMPLE: 

How much material 18 in. wide is needed to make 3 yd. of 
bias facing 1 in. wide (through the bias) when the full length is 
used? 

SOLUTION: 

18 in. X li = 24 in. (length of bias). 

3 yd. or 108 in. -j- 24 (in,) = 4j (times); therefore, 4^ strips or 
6 strips are needed. (The 1 in. through the bias will measure If 
in. bn the selvage.) Five (strips) times If in. = 6j in. or 7 in. of 
material is used. (A part of a strip is counted as a whole strip.) 

A bias strip out from the corner is shorter than the full-length 
bias by twice the width through the bias; each succeeding strip 
toward the corner is shortened in the same manner. 

1. How much material 1 yd. wide is used to make 6 yd. of 
bias trimming, if the bias is 3 in, through the bias? 

2. TVhich makes the wider band, 3 in. through the bias or 3 
m. on the selvage? 

3. If one ruffle is cut on the bias and another on the straight of 
the cloth, which requires the greater number of widths? 

4. Elaine bought'! yd. of material, 59 in. wide, for a bias 
trimming. How many yards of bias can she make from the 
material if the bias is to be If in. through tire bias? 

5. Susan bought ^ yd. of 18-in. material for a bias band.

Goods Cut Bias and Straight (Optional Lesson) 

OBJECTIVE; To find the cost of material one end of which Is cut bn 
the bias and the other on the straight of the goods. 

LESSON 130 

Velvet and silk may be bought with one end cut on the bias and 
the other on the straight of the goods. The cost of the material is 
figured on the longer side. 


One end of material cut on the straight and the oilier end on the bias 

To find the amount of the material used when one end of the 
material is cut on the bias and the other on the straight, fold the 
triangle aho so the c touches a and then measure through the 
middle from d to e which equals the yardage paid for; or, add 
the lengths of the long and the short sides and divide their sum 
by two, and the result is the yardage used. Multiply the yardage 
by the cost per yard to find the cost.

Chapter IX 

SALES TECHNIQUE 


OBJECTIVE; To develop facility in applying your knowledge of 
arithmetic to the practices of the business world. 

Business practices which involve arithmetic are merely the 
fundamentals you have learned in integers, common fractions, 
decimal fractions, percentage, etc., applied to particular cases. 

Salesmen and saleswomen in department stores and other 
business establishments are trained to feel that they are hosts 
and hostesses to the public, and they want their customers to 
consider them as such. One expects the same courtesies in a place 
of business that he would receive in a home. 

Mercliandise stores, telephone companies, insurance companies, 
shoe stores, etc., all have regular training courses in which pro¬ 
spective employees are required to study the technique of that 
particular establishment. In these schools all details are ex¬ 
plained, and when the salesman or saleswoman faces his or her 
customer, the customer is approached in a trained and business¬ 
like manner. 

Printed slips are used in business; these vary in each depart¬ 
ment or firm. Every salesperson is given detailed instructions in 
filling out these slips before he is permitted to serve customers. 

Ctsh-Take Sale 

Porms similar to the one shown are used in stores in which 
there are no cash registers in the various departments.. The 
original is kept by the cashier, with the voucher attached. The 
duplicate is enclosed in the customer’s package. Tissues are held 
by the saleswoman until her book is finished and turned in to the 
cashier, The cashier hands in the unused tissues with her cash

checks. The sample shows that a package belonging to the 
customer has been enclosed with the supervisor’s O.K. 

Straiaht C.O.D. Sale 

When making a straight C.O.D. sale, write the name and 
address of the customer in tlie “cliarge to” space, and have it 
O.K’d by the supervisor. Then send the entire check to the 
packing room with, the merchandise purchased. 

House Charge Sent 

In this form write the name and house number in the “charge 
to” space, and the name and address in the “send to” space. The 
check is O.K’d for discount. Parts of the check are handled as a 
“charge send” check. 


Commercial Bills 

LESSON 146 

It is necessary in any business to know how to make out 
correct comrnerdal bills. Since leading department stores have. 



A typical department-store bill 







tteii own bill forms, typical forms are used to familiarize you 
with their use, calling attention to the form, the receipting of the

Statements and Invoices 


LESSON 147 

A statement is a printed form sent to customers who have 
made use of their charge account during the month. Statements 
usually are sent out at the beginning or end of each month. If 
several orders have been placed in one month and ore not paid 
for by the end of the month, a statement is sent to the purchaser. 
On the statement are listed the dates and the costs of the several 
purchases together with their total. Some firms also include a 
reference number on these forms. These are the numbers of the 
individual bills for the several purchases which are a part of some 
bookkeeping systems. 

An invoice is an itemized bill given or sent to a customer with 
the goods ordered. On an invoice are listed the quantity of 
articles purchased, the names of the articles, their prices, and the 
discounts, if any are allowed.

Countins Change 

OBJECTIVE: To train yourself, when shopping, to count the change 
with the clerk as the change is handed to you, in order to avoid 
mistakes. 

LESSON 148 

The connection between home arithmetic and arithmetic 
taught in school, is well illustrated by the method of counting 
change in stores and shops. You as customers pay little or no 
attention to a clerk when he is counting change and then you 
blame the clerk for not giving you the correct change, when it is 
really yoiir own fault. The following problems are given in which 
the change is to be actually counted in order to awaken interest 
in correct shopping. 

EXAMPLE: 

Count the change received from the clerk if 43(4 is spent out of 
one dollar. Note that you are not to say $1.00 — $ .43 = ? 

SOLUTION: 

43(4 and 2(4 is 45(4 and 5(4 is 50(4; and 50(4 make a dollar. 

1. A customer buys 3f yd. of silk at $2.15 a yard, and 4 yd. of 
trimming at 75(4 a yard. Count the change she receives from $15. 

2. I spent $4.72 out of $10. Count the change. 

3. I spent $2.23 out of $3.00. Count the change. 

4. Count the change received if $1.83 is spent out of $5.00. 

5. I spent $13.46 out of $20. Count the change.

OBJECTIVE; To learn how to read your water, electricity, and gas 
meters, to calculate the cost of operating various appliances, and, 
incidentally, to learn how to use these appliances economically, 
This knowledge and ability will increase your efficiency in house¬ 
keeping or in business. 

How to Read a Water Meier 

A meter is a device for measuring and automatically recording 
and indicating a quantity measured. Meters are used for measur¬ 
ing water, electricity, gas, etc. 

LESSON 164 

The arrow at the bottom of the illustration on page 137 indi¬ 
cates the most certain method of reading; that is, from low to 
high. 

The one-foot circle indicates one cubic foot graduated in tenths, 
This circle is used by inspectors to ascertain quickly whether 
the meter is working, but in all vservice readings it should be 
entirely disregarded. 

Rule: Start with the circle of the lowest denomination and 
read each circle using the lowest of the two .figures between 
which the hand points. 

When the hand is so near a figure as apparently to indicate it 
exactly, refer to the next lower circle, and if the hand has passed 
the 0, the figure indicated is correct; otherwise take the next 
lower. 

The first or right-hand figure of the answer is taken from circle 
10, the second from circle 100, the third from circle 1,000, etc.

From the total reading subtract the previous reading. The 
difiference, then, is the number of cubic feet of water you have 
used since the previous reading of the meter. 

Since you buy water at so much per 100 cubic feet, divide the 
number of cubic feet used by 100 and multiply the result by the 
price per 100 cubic feet (for instance, H in some cities). To the 
cost of the water you may have to add a meter-reading or service 
charge of bOfS.

Measuring Electricity 

LESSON 166 

The meter or “watt-hour meter’’ is a device which measures the 
amount of electricity passing through an electric installation. It 
consists of a series of dials with pointers which are run by a small 
dectric motor. This motor revolves at a speed exactly in pro¬ 
portion to the amount of energy (wattage) used. Whenever a 
lamp or appliance is in use, the motor moves the pointers or 
bands on the dials and shows exactly how much electricity is 



141 


PUBLIC UTILITIES 


consumed. Each meter is made with the greatest care, and is 
periodically tested to insure its continued accuracy. 

Readings are made in kilowatt (1,000 watt) hours. The meter 
tells how much work has been done in one hour by the equivalent 
of 1,000 watts (a kilowatt); that is, if a 1,000-watt appliance is 
used for one hour it consumes 1 kilowatt hour of electricity.* A 
100-watt lamp burns 10 hours before it uses a kilowatt hour. 

Reading a Meter 

The right-hAnd dial governs the one on its left in each instance. 
The pointer on the right dial moves clockwise, the one to the left 
counterclockwise, and the next to the left clockwise, and so on. 

A complete revolution of the pointer on the right-hand dial 
indicates 10 kilowatt hours; the pointer on its left indicates, in one 
revolution, 100 kilowatt hours; the next pointer similarly indi¬ 
cates 1,000 kilowatt hours; while the pointer on the dial on the 
extreme left in one complete revolution indicates 10,000 kilowatt 

hours. „ , 

When a hand on any of the dials is between two figures such as 

2 to 3, 3 to 4, etc., the smaller number is always read. The meter 

is read from right to left. 


EXAMPLE: , 

The following diagram of Mrs. Smith’s meter on February 1, 

shows a reading of 1,323 kilowatt hours; 



On March 1, Mrs. Smith’s meter appeared as shown in the 
circles below. The reading then was 1,845 kilowatt hours. 



•It on overload is givea. an element will burn out or a ^ ^ 

plodn^te burnt-outlusc by a new fuse restores the current for setvi . 



142 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 

To obtain'the consumption, subtract the previous reading 
from the present. If the dial is plain, as in the drawing, you have a 
direct reading and the difference is the actual consumption in 
kilowatt hours. Thus, 1,845 - 1,323 = 522 kilowatt hours, the 
amount of current used in Mrs. Smith’s house during February 

If no one is home when the meter reader calls at yom- house, he 
may leave a card for you to fill out showing the meter reading to 
be mailed to the electric company. That is a problem similar to 
the example ]ust given. 

A discount is allowed on your bill if you pay it before a specified 
date. 

For practice, bring some old electricity bills to school. Note 
the meter readings shown, the rate, the gross bill, and the net 
bill after deducting the discount.

Electrical Appliances 

LESSON 168 

Electrical household appliances transform electrical energy 
into light, heat, or mechanical energy. The cost of operation 
depends upon the number of watts of electricity consumed per 
hour. In general, heat-producing appliances consume much more 
current than motors. 

Based on the cost of electrical current in one city, you can for 
one cent operate one of the following devices for the length of 
time given: 

Lamp (26 watts), 11 hr., 7 min.; lamp (100 watts), 2 hr., 47 
min.; 12-in. fan (50 watts), 5 hr., 33 min.; vacuum cleaner (200 
watts), 1 hr., 23 min.; iron (660 watts), 25 min.; roaster (460 
watts), 36 min. 



144 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 


Solve the following problems supposing the cost of current is 
2^!^ per kilowatt hour. Note that a 60-watt bulb uses 60 watt 
hours of current in one hour. 

1. The Jackson home has the following lights in the living 
room: an indirect ceiling fixture with three 60-watt bulbs; three 
wall fixtures each with a 25-watt bulb; a direct-indirect reflector 
floor lamp with one 300-watt bulb and three 25-watt bulbs. What 
does it cost to burn all of these lights from 7 o’clock to 10 o’clock? 

2. How much current is consumed by a 460-watt roaster in 
cooking the dinner, if it takes three hours to roast the meat? 
How much will this current cost? 

3. A washing-machine motor consumes about 200 watts of 
current per hour. How much per hour does it cost to operate this 
machine? 

Reading a Gas Meter 

A gas meter is similar to a water meter. However, there are 
only three dials to be read. The dial on the right registers up to 
1,000 cu. ft. Each figure represents so many hundred cu. ft. The 
middle dial shows how many thousand cu. ft. up to 10,000; and 
the dial on the left shows how many times you have used 10,000 
cu. ft. up to 100,000. In reading, begin on the left. 

LESSON 169 



The meter shown above now reads: 30,000 -|- 8,000 + 600 = 
38,600 cu. ft. of gas used. At the previous reading, it appeared as 
below showing 32,700 cu. ft. 



38,600 cu. ft. — 32,700 cu. ft. = 5,900 cu. ft., the amount of 
gas used since the previous reading.

The Telephone 

LESSON 171 

The telephone is so essential in business and so useful in the 
home that everyone should learn how to use it properly and to 
avoid its abuse. Skill in using the telephone is a valuable asset in 
any kind of commercial work. Moreover, the telephone companies 
offer employment to a great many people, including, besides 
operators and their supervisors, ail the usual office positions— 
stenographers, clerks, cashiers, etc. 



A typical telephone bill 


An itemized list of long-distance calls, etc., accompanies the 
monthly bill. 

The statement for long-distance service indicates the cost of 
calls from one city to another. This cost depends on the class of 
call, whether it is Station-to-Station or Person-to-Person. It is to 
be noted, of course, that billing forms, periods of service covered, 
discount practices, and classes of service offered, vary in different 
communities. 

The teacher will dictate twenty numbers from the telephone 
book. Write these numbers from dictation. This is a lesson in 












A section of a awitdiboiipd in a long-distance telephone office 


listening wliich is required of a switchboard operator or an order

THE FAMILY BUDGET 


OBJECTIVE: To teach you as a future homemaker how to spend your 
income wisely. To sive you some practice in computing interest on 
money that you borrow directly or borrow indirectly in buying on the 
installment plan. 

A homeinflker is tlie financial manager of a business establish¬ 
ment; that is, she must plan to meet the expenses of the family 
according.to the family income. This means that she must 
understand how to budget the money she handles. A family 
budget is a careful plan to make the family income cover all 
needs. There are certain necessary expenses to be paid each 
month, such as those for food, shelter, clothing, education, 
health, insurance, and savings. Authorities differ as to the per¬ 
centage of income to be used for each of these items, but they all 
insist on the necessity of savings for emergencies and old age. 
Merely balancing the expense account with the income does not 
provide for these vital necessities. 

The father of a family provides the money for the home, but 
the mother adds very much indeed to the family income, not only 
by the work which she does so willingly, but especially through 
competent management. 

Most of the chapters of Applied Mathematics foe Girls 
present information needed in managing a home. This chapter 
gives you some practice in making a budget. It also shows by 
example how you can save by buying for cash when possible, and 
it provides you with a basis for choosing the best of several ways 

to obtain credit when necessary.

Installment Buying 

LESSON 174 

A young couple have enough money saved to buy the most 
necessary items of furniture, but they want $120 to purchase odd 
pieces to complete their home equipment. 

They borrow this on a contract to repay in 20 months at $6.00 
a month with interest on the unpaid balance. At the end of the 
first month they will be required to pay back $6.00 on the prin¬ 
cipal with interest charged at the rate of 2|% per month on the 
$100 and 2% on the $20. At the end of the fourth month the loan 
will be paid down to less tlian $100, and thereafter only the 2j% 
monthly rate will apply. Therefore, their payments will be as 
follows:

If they follow the minimum schedule of payments, as above, 
the interest charge over 20 months (nearly 2 years) will total 
$31.28, However, they are encouraged to make larger payments 
of principal and thus save interest. If they pay the loan out in 
ten equal payments of $12 each, the interest charge would be 
$16.36. In five equal monthly payments of $24 each, the interest 
charge would be $8.90. Since the interest is collected only on the 
balance remaining unpaid at the end of each month, it is possible 
for the borrower to reduce the amount of the interest charge by 
making his monthly payments as large as possible. 

In the case just explained, the borrowers have paid a very high 
rate of interest. If they could have done without the additional 
pieces of furniture till they had saved enough money to buy 
them, they would have saved more than a fourth of the cost. 

It would be useful to get the actual carrying charge which a 
merchant makes on an installment purchase, but many times the

purchaser cannot learn the markup which is included in the price 
to cover this. However, by insisting on a discount for cash, the 
purchaser should be able to get the furniture dealer to reduce the 
price an amount at least equivalent to the cost of a loan repaid in 
10 months. 

It would also be interesting to observe the saving one can make 
by accumulating the money in advance to pay cash. 

Interest rates on merchandise loans vary in different states.

Credit Unions 


LESSON 176 

A credit union is a cooperative society, organized in accord¬ 
ance with the provisions of a state law with three primary pur¬ 
poses : (a) to promote thrift among the members through a sys¬ 
tem of savings which specializes in the smallest units of saving, 
and, by a weekly saving plan, makes saving a habit; (6) to use the 
funds so accumulated for the benefit of those who accumulate 
them by creating credit for the members at a low rate of interest 
for provident purposes i and (c) to educate the members in matters 
pertaining to the investment and care of their savings. 

Credit unions are organized within existing groups, such as 
employees of a company or local government, members of an 
organization, a church parish, or neighbors. 

The money is accumulated exclusively from members and is 
used for loans exclusively to members, and all resulting profits 
are divided among the members as interest or dividends. A 
member may deposit an amount as small as 25 fi at a time and 
build up a fund with such small installments. A member may 
borrow any sum approved by a credit committee made up of 
members. Small amounts may be obtained without security, 
and larger sums may be secured with collateral or over the sig¬ 
natures of one or two other members of the credit union who will 
be responsible for the repayment of the loan in case of failure 
on the part of the borrower to do so. 

Interest rates differ in the various credit unions, but the 
maximum rate is 1% a month on the balance remaining unpaid. 
Repayment of the loan is made within the time agreed upon 
between the borrower and the officers of the credit union. In 
this system, each payment on the loan reduces not only the 
principal but also the interest. 



157 


THE FAMILY BUDGET 

For instance, if a member of a credit union wishes to buy cloth¬ 
ing, or furniture, or an automobile, etc., he may borrow the entire 
amount from his credit union and then repay the loan in monthly 
installments. The following tabulation states in detail the process 
of repaying a loan of $100 in ten months, at 1% interest a month 
on the unpaid balance.

Buying a Home on the F.H.A. Plan 

LESSON 178 

The Federal Housing Act sponsors a system of buying homes 
on the long-time, part-payment plan. The chief features of this 
plan are; (1) low financing charges; (2) long-term loans extending 
over periods of 25, 20, or 15 years; (3) advancement by lender of 
a large part of the total value (up to 80 or 90%); (4) repayment in 
monthly installments (about like rent) suited to the borrower’s 
income; (5) inclusion of taxes, assessments, and fire insurance in 
the monthly payment; (6) elimination of second mortgages and 
the need for periodic and expensive refinancing; (7) protection of 
the lender by a system of mutual mortgage insurance; (8) im¬ 
provement of housing standards and conditions.

The following “steps” toward home ownership are typical of 
a purchase made under the plan recommended by the Federal 
Housing Administration. 

1. Decide upon the amount of money to he invested accordmg 
to salary. 

2. Choose a type of home best suited to the family needs. 

3. Talk things over with an architect, builder, and real-estate

4. Consult the F.H.A. and apply for an insured mortgage at a 
bank, finance company, life-insurance company, or building-and- 

loan association. . 

5. The amount of the loan, charges, etc., can be arranged with 

the lender who will be guided by F.H.A. limits. 

6. Cash is not necessary for a down payment if you own a lot; 
a lot may be accepted as the down payment. 

7. When the loan is made, it is necessary to provide money for 
the first year’s taxes, assessments, and fire insurance. After the 
first year, the taxes, insurance, etc., are included in each monthly 

payment and are paid in advance. ,, • mi.

Upholsterins Problems 

The average housewife feels incompetent to upholster a piece of 
furniture. The following suggestions and a study of the materials 
used in upholstery may be helpful. Some of the materials used 
by an upholsterer are velour, cotton, wool, silk, and mohair. 

Materials which are SO in. wide usually cost from $3.60 to 
$7.50 a yard (these prices vary from year to year)-. Further prices 
are as follows: 

Mohair cloth, 50 in. wide, $4.75 to $7.50 a yard. 

Frieze, 60 in. wide, $4.50 a yard, and up. 

Cretonnes, 28 in. to 60 in. wide, 81|4 a yard, and up. 

Denims, $1.60 a yard, and up. 

Damask, $3.50 a yard. 

LESSON 190 

Some materials come in 24-in., 28-in., 32-in., and 50-in. 
widths. When estimating the amount of material, it is necessary 
to allow for waste in matching designs in patterns in upholstery 
material as well as in wallpaper, carpets, draperies, etc. 

EXAMPLE! 

What will it cost to upholster a chair, the inside back of which 
is 20 in. long, the seat 20 in., the arm 15 in., and the outside back 
18 in., with frieze 34 in. wide at $4.50 a yard? 

SOLUTION: 

20 in. -f 20 in. -|- 30 in. -{- 18 in. = 07 in. = 2 yd. 25 in. 
Use 3 yd. to allow for waste, etc. $4.50 X 3 = $13.50. 

Figure the cost of the tape or cord, tacks, lining, twine, spring, 
webbing, and padding (hair, moss, or cotton felt; tow or oakum 
is sometimes used). Estimate the cost of material to cover a 
chair in your own bedroom. Use cretonne at SOfl a yard. Measure 
the yards or inches of tape or cord, lining, twine, spring, webbing, 
and padding as needed, and obtain the costs of these from an up¬ 
holsterer at the time they are to be used. 

Slip Covers 

A neat slip cover transforms a shabby chair or davenport into 
a beautiful piece of furniture. To achieve this result, however, it 



'IMPROVEMENTS OF THE HOME 


185 


is necessary to be exact in your measurements and careful in 
cutting and sewing. Upholsterers say tliat the average amount 
of material to cover a large chair is 9 yd. of 36-in. material, or 
6 yd. of 50-in. material. An average davenport requires about 
19 yd. of 36-in. material, or 13 yd. of 60-in. material. Since 
chairs and davenports vary in size and shape, it will prove help¬ 
ful to know how to find the exact amount of material needed. 


Measuring the Chair 

LESSON 191 

1. The depth of the valance (the draping from the sent to the 
floor) is equal to | of the distance from the top of the cushion to 
the floor (6 or 8 in.). Mark this line around the chair. To the 

depth of the valance add 1^ in. for the 
hem, and f in. for the turn at the top. 
To provide for fullness, measure the 
distance around the chair and multi¬ 
ply it by 3. This product is then 
divided by the width of the material; 
the quotient is then multiplied by the 
depth plus the hem and seam of the 
flounce. 

2. Measure from the valance line to the mid-point of the top 
of the back, then down to the seat. 

3. Add 4 ill. for tucking in and continue measuring over the 
seat and down to the valance in front. Add C in. for the hem and 
seams. 

4. Next, measure from the point where the seat joins the arms, 
up over the arm and down to the valance. Add 6 in. If the width 
of the material will cover both arms (allowing for seams), this 
amount will take care of both arms. If the arm is wider than one 
half the width, multiply the last measurement taken by 2. 

5. Add the various measurements taken to find the total 
number of inches or yards needed. If figured material is used, 
allow extra for matching. 




186 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 

Slip-Cover Problems 

1. How muct SO-in. material will be needed to make a slip 
cover to fit a chair that has a valance line of 98 in. (valance is to 
be 8 in. deep). From the back valance line over to the seat is 52 
in.; from the back of the seat to the' front valance line is 31 in. 
The arm measures 36 in. and is 30 in. wide. If cretonne is 79^ per 
yard, find the cost. 

2. Measure one of your chairs at home, and find out how much 
material will be needed to cover it. 

Lamp Shades 

To make a lamp shade, the following materials are necessary: 
frame; foundation materials or interlining; covering of chifion, 
silk, or parchment; trimmings, including braid, fringe, bead, 
niching; ornaments, such as silhouettes, butterflies, stencil 
design, painted design, and flowers. 

LESSON 192 

To find the number of yards of material for the foundation, 
first divide the circumference of the base by the width of the 
material, to find the number of strips used (a part of a strip is 
considered as a whole); then the number of strips multiplied by 
the height of the shade equals the number of yards used for 
lining, Cut a paper pattern to fit the frame before cutting the 
material. If chiffon or net is used for the outside, an interlining 
IS necessary. - ° 

To find the amount of chiffon or silk for the outside, if it is 
pla-in, the same method is used to find the yardage as for the 
lining. But. if chiffon is used, and it is to be gathered or pleated, 
the circumference at the base is multiplied by two for shirring and 
by three for the single pleats to allow for the desired fullness 
This result is divided by the width of the material to find the 
number of strips used, and the number of strips multiplied by the 

height of the shade equals the number of yards or parts of a yard 
used. 

To find the number of yards of trimming, if braid is used, add 
the top and bottom circumferences, allowing for the seams. If 
ruching is made for trimming, the sum of the circumferences

Floor Coverings 

Sometimes it is advisable to cover an old pine floor with lin¬ 
oleum instead of laying a new hardwood floor. 

Inlaid linoleum costs from $1.69 to $4.00 a square yard; 
printed or stamped linoleum costs from 69fi to $1.29 a square 
yard. 

EXAMPLE: 

What will it cost to cover a floor 12 ft. by 15 ft. with inlaid 
linoleum at $1.59 a square yard? 

SOLUTION: 

12 ft. X 15 (ft.) = 180 sq. ft. 

9 sq. ft. = 1 sq. yd. 

180 sq. ft. -r 9 = 20 sq. yd. 

$1.59 X 20 = $31.80, cost of linoleum.

inlaid linoleum when the kitchen measures 12 ft. by 14 ft., and 
the bathroom 8 ft. by 7 ft., if the linoleum costs $1.95 per square 
yard? 

3. What would it cost to cover the same kitchen and bathroom 
in Problem 2 with printed linoleum at 89|4 per square yard? 

4. Find the cost of a good quality of printed linoleum at $1.69

Hardwood Floors 

LESSON 195 

Birch, beech, maple, and oak are used for hardwood floors. 
These woods are bought by the square foot. Figure the square 
feet in a given floor and add ^ to that amount for matching. 



IMPROVEMENTS OF THE HOME 189 

Flooring to cover an old floor is less expensive than for a new 
floor because a thinner flooring can be used. 

EXAMPLE: 

What will it cost to lay a hardwood floor in a kitchen which is 
10 by 12 ft., with No. 1 maple at $65 per 1,000 sq. ft.? Add to 
square surface for matching the lumber. 

SOLUTION: 

10 ft. X 12 (ft.) = 120 sq. ft. 

3 of 120 sq. ft. = 40 sq. ft. 

120 sq. ft. + 40 sq. ft. = 160 sq. ft. 

160 sq. ft. 4- 1,000 sq. ft. = .16 
$65 X .16 = $10.40 cost of lumber. 

Add to the cost of the lumber the cost of the labor, and the cost 
of the finish, such as oil, shellac, and varnish, to e.stimate the 
complete cost of the floor. 

Flooring Problems 

1. What will it cost to lay a hardwood floor in a room 15 by

lumber.) 

4. A department store is reeovering all its 3 floors with hard¬ 
wood. If the store is 24 ft. long and 90 ft. wide, what will be the 
cost at $78 per 1,000 sq. ft.? 

5. In Problem 4, at $2.95 per gallon, how much would it cost 
to varnish all 3 floors if one gallon covers 600 sq. ft.? 

Carpeting 

LESSON 196 

Carpet comes in strips which are usually 27 in. wide and it is 
sold by the yard. In carpeting a room it happens frequently that 



190 


APPLIED MAThEMAriCS FOR GIRLS 


the width makes it necessary to split the last strip. In this case 
it is necessary to buy and pay for the full strip. In figuring the 
amount of carpet, the rule is to divide the width of the room by 
the width of the carpet in order to determine the number of 
strips. The number of strips is then multiplied by the length of 
the room expressed in yards, The product is the number of yards 
of carpet needed. 

This does not allow for waste in matching. A small pattern 
wUl cause very little waste; a large pattern may be sewed up 
with no waste if the length of the pattern can be divided into the 
length of a strip without a remainder. Thus the waste on the job 
may be practically nothing or it may be, in some cases, two or 
three yards. Solve the following problems with no allowance 
for wa.ste. 

EXAMPLE: 

How much will it cost to cover a room 15 ft. 9 in. by 16 ft. 
with 27-in. carpet at $2.75 per yd.p 

SOLUTION: 

15 ft. 9 in. = 189 inches. 

189 -H 27 = 7 = number of strips. 

16 ft. = 5i yd. 

X 7 = 37-^ = number of yards. 

$2.75 X 37f = $102.33 = cost.

what must each church pay? 

7. If one of the churches can pay only one half of its share, the 
other five churches divide the remaining amount among them¬ 
selves. What is the final payment of each of the five churches? 

Papering a Room 

LESSON 197 

Paper hangers charge for hanging paper by the roll; removing 
old paper and sizing the walls and ceiling are extra charges. 

The entire cost can be estimated by adding the cost of labor 
to the cost of paper and border. 

Various methods are used to estimate the amount of paper for 
the walls and ceiling of a room without allowances for the match¬ 
ing of patterns in the paper. 

ONE METHODi 

The perimeter of a room (length of four walls) by the width 
of the paper = number of strips for the walls. 

Length of roll -4- the height of room = number of strips in a 
roll. 

Number of strips in a room - 4 - number of strips in a roll = the 
number of rolls. 

Pigure the ceiling in the same way. 

EXAMPLE: 

Find the cost of paper for the walls and ceiling of a room 

12 by 12 ft. and 8 ft. high, at 35^ a roll and 15j4 a yard for the 

border. The paper is 1^ ft. wide. 

SOLUTION: 

48 ft. -4- 1^ = 32 = number of strips for the walls. 

24 ft. (length of roll) -4-8=3 = number of strips in a roll. 

32 strips -4- 3 = 10 plus. Hence 11 rolls for the walls. 

12 ft. -4- 1| = 8 = number of strips in ceiling. 

24 ft. -4- 12 = 2 = number of strips in one roll. 



192 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 


8 strips -5-2 = 4 = number of rolls for the ceiling. 

11 rolls -H 4 rolls = 15 rolls for walls and ceiling. 

35^ X 15 = $5.25 = cost of paper. 

48 ft. -i- 3 = 16 = number of yards of border. 

15ji X 18 = $2.40 = cost of border. 

$5.26 + $2.40 = $7.65, the cost of paper and border. 

Some dealers allow 20 sq. ft. for openings, and some allow 3 
ft. for each opening (doors and windows). One dealer’s rule is to 
allow 2 rolls for 3 doors or windows. 

ANOTHER METHOD: 

Length (perimeter) of walls X height of room = sq. ft. in walls. 

Length X width of room = sq. ft. in ceiling. 

Sq. ft. in walls -f sq. ft. in ceiling = sq. ft. in room. 

Total number of sq. ft. -r 36 (sq. ft. in one roll) = number of 
rolls. 

Cost of one roll multiplied by the number of rolls equals the 
cost of the paper. 

Length of walla in ft. -5- 3 = number of yards of border. 

Cost of border per yard X number of yards = cost of border. 

Cost of paper + cost of border = cost of both. 

Papering Problems 

1. Find the cost of paper for the walls and ceiling of a room, 
16 by 12 by 9 ft., the paper at 47jf a roll. 

2. What will it cost to paper the walls of a room measuring 
19 by 15 ft. and 10 ft. high above the baseboard? Allow 4 in.

25|!f a roll? 

3. Paper is required for two rooms; one is 9 by 12 ft., and the 
other is 8 by 11 ft. Both rooms are 9 ft. high. How'many rolls 
will be necessary, and what will be the cost of the paper at 35^ 
a roll? 

LESSON 198 

1. Find the coat of paper for 2 rooms each 15 by 14 ft. and

(Deduct for openings in each room.) At 45j4 per roll, find the 
cost. 

4. A large hall is to be papered. It is 20 ft. high, 100 ft. long, 
and 80 ft. wide. At 49jl per roll, what is the cost of the papering 
of the hall? (Deduct 80 sq. ft. for openings.) 

5. Fifteen rooms of a hotel are to be repapered. Since all of 
the rooms are 13 by 12 ft. and 8 ft. high, find the total cost at 
53(4 per roll. (Deduct 20 sq. ft. for each room.) 


Painting Walls and Woodwork 

When a home is being remodeled, or a new one built, it is well 
for the woman who is to occupy that home to make a study of 
the interior decoration. Though she does not actually do the 
work herself, she can estimate the cost of the material required, 
and, by adding the cost of labor, she can determine whether or ' 
not the contractor’s estimate is reasonable. 

The purpose of staining woodwork is to give it the desired 
color and, in some cases, to bring out the beauty of the grain. 
Varnish is used to preserve the stain and the wood. Each kind of 
wood requires a different kind of treatment. Manufacturers of . 
paint and varnish are ready to give information as to the use of 
paint, stain, varnish, shellac, etc. 

Paint for walls or woodwork is sold by the gallon. One gallon 
of paint will cover about 350 sq. ft. of surface, ■with two coats. 
A gallon of varnish will cover about 600 sq. ft., with one coat. 

Before the walls are painted, they must be sized with a glue 
material which fills the pores of the plaster and causes the paint 
to “stick” without peeling. It takes two or three coats of paint 
for walls after they are sized. Walls are glue-sized before paper 
is hung. Hough plaster is better suited for tints and paints, 
while the smooth finish is better for paper. If walls are to - 
painted, a better quality of plaster is more economical. 



APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 


194 

LESSON 199 

One gallon of mixed paint is calculated to cover from three to 
four hundred square feet of surface, with two coats (350 sq. ft. 
to a gallon). The cost of outside paint is from $2.50 to $3.75 a 
gallon; interior paints cost less. 

Doors and windows are not deducted when estimating the 
square surface to be painted for outside paint, but for inside paint, 
openings ai'e deducted. 

Divide the surface in square feet by 350 to obtain the number of 
gallons of paint required, and the number of gallons times the 
cost per gallon equals the cost of the paint. 

EXAMPLE: 

Find the cost of paint for the outside of a cottage 24 by 20 by 
18 ft. 

SOLUTION: 

24 ft. X 2 = 48 ft. = length of 2 side walls. 

20 ft. X 2 = 40 ft. = length of 2 end walls. 

48 ft. + 40 ft. = 88 ft. = length of 4 walls. 

88 ft. X 18 (height of cottage) = 1,584 sq. ft. in the walls. 

1,584 sq. ft. 4- 350 (1 gal. of paint covers 350 sq. ft.) = 4 gal. 
plus or 5 gal. of paint. 

$2.50 (cost of 1 gal.) X 5 = $12.95 = cost of paint. 

Add the cost of the labor to the cost of the paint to get the 
entire cost. An experienced painter can tell about how many days 
. it will take him to do the work and in that way can compare the 
cost as he figures it by the job and the cost of material plus the 
labor. It is both interesting and profitable to estimate costs on 
aU work done for a home.

. I .. Sodding Problems 

LESSON 200 

It is cheaper to scatter seeds and make sod than to lay sod, but 
when it is necessary to have a lawn in a short time, sodding is 
advisable, In order to have sod do well, it is necessary to have 
3 to 4 in. of good black soil before the sod is laid. 

Top soil is sold by the load, which consists of 2 cu. yd., and 
costs about $3.50 a load. Sod is sold at about 15|4 a square yard. 
To this you must add the cost of labor for laying the sod and 
bringing the lot up to the required level, the amount depending 
upon the time required to do the work.

Chapter XIV 
TAXES 


OBJECTIVE: To acquire an understanding of the principles of taxation 
and the ability to compute your own taxes or those of your employers. 

The city, county, state, and the United States governments in 
order to function properly, must have administrative depart¬ 
ments that keep the machinery of these governments running 
smoothly. Under the common council and the mayor, the county 
board, the state legislature, and Congress, the various service de¬ 
partments make possible the economical and efficient operation 
of government. 

The city, county, state, and federal governments must be 
■supported. Money for these expenses is raised through various 
systems of taxation. 

The real-estate valuation is made by the assessor and the tax 
rate is fixed at a certain amount on each $1,000 of property 
valuation. That rate must be high enough to cover the budget 
set up by the various departments of the government. An 
assessor is elected or appointed by the town, city, or county to 
appraise property; that is, to set the value on property. 

Incomes are taxed in some states on $1,000 or more, with 
deductions for heads of families and their dependents. Surtax is 
computed on net income"in excess of a certain amount and is 
used for old-age assistance, mother’s pensions, commdn-school 
aids, teachers’ pensions, etc. 

All persons whose income reaches a specified miniTniiTn amount 
must pay a federal income tax unless he is entitled to sufficient 
exemptions for dependents, etc., to offset the tax. 

All industries pay federal as well as state taxes on their profits. 
Franchise taxes are paid by corporations for the privileges of 
doing business in the state under the state laws. 

198 



TAXES 


199 


State inheritance taxes vary in different states. The federal 
inheritance tax is, of course, collected at a fixed rate throughout 
the nation. If the inheritance is left to more than one heir, each 
heir pays his share of the tax. 

Luxury tax is paid by means of stamps placed on each article 
sold. 

Some states collect a sales tax; 3 cents on $1.00; 2 cents on 60 
cents; 1 cent on 15 to SO cents. This tax is paid by the customer 
at the time of the purchase and is used by the state government 
for special purposes. 

Other taxes are customs and duties, license fees for automo¬ 
biles, gasoline tax, hunting and fishing licenses, dog licenses, 
marriage license. A poll tax, collected in some states, is a fixed 
amount, usually only a few dollars, paid by each adult citizen.

In the cities of the United States, the tax rate varies; in some 
cities, property may be assessed at 100% of its value; in others, 
the assessment may be made at a rate as low as 33^%, or 60%, 
according to each city’s laws, customs, and budget plan. 

EXAMPLE; 

A property valued at $10,000 was assessed at 90% of its value. 
The taxes amounted to $37.25 per $1,000 or $335.25. 

$10,000 X 90% = $9,000 
$9,000 ^ 1000 = 9 
$37.25 X 9 = $335.25

The comparison on page 202 shows the relationship between the 
percentage value and the degrees of a circle. Using the figures 
accompanying the budget outline, work the following problems: 

1. Find the amount of money that the government collects 
from income tax ($5,520,000,000 X 21.2%). 

2. How much more money must be collected to meet the 
total expense after the 37% of borrowings is collected? 

3. What is the difference between the amount collected by 
social-security taxes and that paid out for social security?

Federal Income Tax 

Every citizen of the United States and every foreigner residing 
in the United States must make an annual report of Ih.s income 
to the Federal Government if he comes under one of the following 
classifications: 

1. Single. If his gross income is $800 or more. 

2 . Married. If his gross income is $2,000 or more. 

There are further details; for instance, the reporting of the 
incomes of both husband and wife, etc. Gross income is the total 
income from all sources; net income is the remainder after various 
deductions are made. The tax is figured on a net taxable iiicoine. 

From his gross income, one may deduct contributions made to 
religious, charitable, or educational organizations and to certain 
other agencies of public welfare; also interest paid on debts and 
taxes paid. Other deductions allowed include losses in l)u.sine.ss 
transactions and losses from debts which others owe to you and 
you cannot collect. Subtract the sum of all the.se items from the 
gross income and the remainder is the net income. 

From this net income deduct what are called “exemptions.” 
The first of these is an “earned-income credit.” For persons who.se 
income is $3,000 or less this credit is 10%oft]ie net inct)in(^. A.

married person or the head of a family $2,000. ('I’liis may be

daimed by either husband or wife but not by both.) Finally, 
there is a credit of $400 allowed for each dependent member of 
the family. The sum of all these exemptions is to be deducted 
from the net income. This gives you the balance of net income 
which is taxable. 

If there is any balance left after the last subtraction, the 
normal tax to be paid is 4% of that balance. According to the 
Revenue Act of 1940, add 10% to the normal tax. This latter is 
a Defense Tax which applies to incomes until January 1,1945. 

Mr. Brown's Income Tax 

Let us find out just how Hemy J. Brown, a single man with no 
dependents, figures his federal income tax. Mr. Brown is allowed 
an exemption of $S00, 

LESSON 205 

1. Mr. Brown’s salary is $2,300; he receives $242 interest from 
bonds and $160 interest on other investments, Find his total 
gross income, 

2. Deductions are allowed for contributions as follows: $15 to 
the Community Fund, $5 to the Red Cross, $2 to the antitubercu¬ 
losis fund, $22 to his church, and $4 to aid handicapped children. 
Find the total of his contributions. 

3. Mr. Brown is allowed deductions of $18.46 for his state 
income tax and $37.45 for a loss on a bad debt. Find the total of 
these two deductions. 

4. Find the total deductions in Problems 2 and 3. 

5. Subtract the total deductions in Problem 4 from the total 
income in Problem 1. This difference is Mr. Brown’s net income. 

6 . 10% of the net income in 5 equals the earned-income credit. 
What is Mr. Brown’s earned-income credit? 

7. Mr. Brown’s earned-income credit plus his personal ex¬ 
emption equals his total exemption. What is his total exemption? 

8 . Deduct the total exemption in 7 from the net income in 5 
and that difference equals the net taxable income. Find the net 
taxable income. 

9. 4% of the net taxable income equals the United States 
Normal Income Tax for Mr. Brown. Add 10% to the normal tax 
for Defense Tax. What is his total tax?

A Head of a Family 

For the first time, the United States Government, in 1040, 
asked those individuals, other than married persons living with 
husband or wife, who claimed exemption as head of a family with 
one or more dependents to fill out a blank on which was listed the 
costs for the year of the following: gas; electricity; heat (oil, gas, 
or coal); house (owned by whom?); property tax; part-time or 
full-time help needed in the home; auto insurance; improvements 
in the home; painting, cement floor, plumbing, roof, furnace 
repairs, electric wiring, etc. 

Louis Graham is a single man who supports a young brother 
and sister both under 18 years of age. He claimed a personal 
exemption of $2,500* as the head of a family and a credit of $800 


*Jlt. Graham made hie report before the Beveaue Act of 1040 lowered the peraooal exemption 
to 43,000 for a, bead of a family and VBOO for a lingle pereon.

Chapter XV 
INSURANCE 


OBJECTIVE: To become familiar with the forms end terms used in 
insurance; to understand the respective merits of the various forms of 
insurance policies, particularly in life insurance, and to gain skill, in 
computing premiums and values. 

An insurance policy is a contract between the insured or the 
policyholder and the underwriter. The payments made by the 
insured on an insurance contract at stated intervals are called 
premiums. 

Fire and Casualty Insurance 

Pire-iiisurance companies are organized to insure mainly 
against the loss of real or personal property; thus we have policies 
of fire and lightning, windstorm and hail, explosion, riot, earth¬ 
quake, smoke and smudge, sprinkler leakage, consequential 
damage, profits, and use and occupancy. There are some other 
special forms of policies designed for particular hazards which are 
not common enough to classify. To the home-owner or the in¬ 
habitant of a dwelling or apartment the most common forms of 
policies issued by fire insurance and casualty companies are: 

1. Fire, lightning, smoke, and .smudge on dwelling and con¬ 
tents. 

2. Windstorm and hail on dwelling and contents. 

3. If jewelry and silverware of any value are owned, it is 
customarily the practice to insure against the loss of these 
articles through theft or damage caused by fire, etc. 

Casualty insurance companies are organized in the main to 
insure against the responsibility (legal liability) placed on a person, 
firm, or corporation, by law, for injuries or property damage 

S09 







INSURANCE 211 

sustained by others because of the ownership or use of personal 
or real property. In this class are the following policies: 

1. Automobile liability and property damage. 

2. Residence public liability. 

3. Boiler explosion. 

4. Compensation. 

5. Manufacturers’ and contractors’ liability and property 
damage. 

6. Sports liability. 

In addition, casualty-insurance companies also insure against 
direct loss of property. In this classihcation we have: burglary, 
larceny, and theft; plate glass; and personal accident and health 
policies. 

The rates for the various types of insurance are, in most cases, 
governed by a semipublic rating bureau, which is a group of 
insurance men elected from among their own membership, or by a 
bureau composed of representatives of various companies. The 
Fire Insurance Rating Bureau is ah example of the first case, 
and the National Bureau of Casualty and Surety Underwriters 
(which announces casualty rates) is an example of the second type. 

There are some policies for which no set rates are maintained: 
the insurance underwriter determines the nece-ssary amount of 
premium required properly to underwrite the risk, and the 
premiums for these .special types will vary as occasion, physical 
hazards, and type of merchandise requii’e. 

Policies other than fire insurance are uniformly similar in most 
respects as a result of competition and in agreement between 
companies issuing these policies. The companies have found that 
a more or less uniform policy results in less confusion in the minds 
of the public. 


Property Insurance 

Residences, hotels, apartments, churches, and schools may be 
insured against fire, tornado, lightning, etc., the policy being 
written for a one-, three-, or five-year period. The premiums of 
three- and five-year policies are computed according to the one- 



212 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 


year rate; that is, 2^ times the one-year rate for three years and 
4 times the one-year rate for five years. For example: If the rate 
is $1.00 per $100 for one year, it is 2^ times that ($2.50) for three 
years, and 4 times that ($4.00) for five years. 

The rates of fire insurance are dependent upon the character 
of the fire hazards. A frame building with wooden shingles has a 
higher rate than a brick building with a composition roof or a 
slate or tile roof. Fire losses are replaced according to the kind 
and the quality of goods damaged less the normal depreciation. 

Automobile Insurance 

There are two types of automobile insurance, liability and col¬ 
lision insurance. Liability insurance covers damage to property 
of others and personal injury, and the rates are determined by 
the classification of the car. Cars are classified as to their weight, 
value, and the purposes for which they are manufactured, as cars 
used for truckmg, bus service, pleasure, etc. Insurance against 
fire, theft, and windstorm also is based on the car’s classification. 

Collision insurance covers damage done to one’s own car by 
sudden contact with a moving or stationary object. Few car 
owners carry this insurance because of the high premiums on it. 


Personal Insurance 

Personal insurance includes accident, health, or life insurance. 
Policies may be taken out individually or in a group. In group 
insurance the workers in one establishment or’other group are 
insured together. In this type, the premium may be the same for 
all, regardless of age, and no medical examination is required if 
each person is in reasonably good health. Personal life insurance 
which is taken independently requires a thorough physical 
examination and the premium rate increases with the age of the 
applicant. 

Workmen’s compensation is an insurance that must be carried 
by employers to help cover expenses incurred through accident 
while their employees are at work. That protection is required 
by the state. 



INSURANCE 


213 


Life Insurance 

Mr. Darwin P. Kingsley lias said that: 

“Life insurance is the hostage which man gives to a selfish 
world for the security of his family and himself; life insurance 
organizes generations as an army organizes individuals; life in¬ 
surance is the short and simple answer to the socialists and theo¬ 
rists, who say that every man has a natural right to air, light, some¬ 
thing to eat, and a chance in life; life insurance guarantees all 
this without beggary or robbery; life insurance is the supplement 
which a wise man adds to his marriage vow—it goes farther than 
‘until death us do part’; life insurance is civilization, morality, 
temperance, virtuous living, practical religion.” 

The primary guarantee by a life-insurance company is to pay a 
certain amount of cash immediately at the death of the policy¬ 
holder provided death occurs while the policy is in force. 

The policyholder agrees to pay to the insurance company a 
definite amount of money, called a premium, at regular intervals 
for a stated number of years, or for life. 

A beneficiary is the person named in the policy, who is to 
receive the insurance money in event of the policyholder’s death. 

To show the importance of this life-insurance protection, let us 
consider the financial situation of a typical family. The husband 
earns a moderate salary, sufficient to give his wife and his young 
children all the necessities and a few of the luxuries of life; but 
he has been able to save up, perhaps, only about a thousand 
dollars. If he were to die, his wife and children would be practi¬ 
cally penniless in a short time. Through life insurance, however, 
even a man of modest means can arrange to provide an adequate 
income for his family over a period of years after his death. 

Life insurance helps to keep families together. It relieves them 
from the humiliation of dependence upon the help of relatives, 
friends, or public charity. It enables a father to continue to 
shelter his loved ones from financial adversity long after his death. 

Types of Policies 

The two most important types of life-insurance policies are 
called “life" and “endowment” policies. 

Life policies insure the policyholder for life and the insurance 



214 


APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 


is payable at death. Premiums are payable either for life (ordi¬ 
nary life policy), or for a specified number of years (limited- 
payment life policy). 

Endowment policies do not run for life, but for a definite 
period of years only, such as 10,15,20, or 30 years, or to a certain 
age, such as age 55, 60, or 65. The face amount of insurance is 
paid to the beneficiary if the policyholder dies during the en¬ 
dowment period. If living at the end of the endowment period, 
the insurance is payable to the policyholder himself. 

We have space for only a brief description of a few of the 
chief provisions of one policy, and shall select the “income 
endowment.” 

An income endowment policy provides that if the policyholder 
pays premiums each year until a specified age (generally 55, 60, 
or 65) the insurance company will then pay the policyholder a 
monthly income for the rest of his or her life, or a certain amount 
of cash, it preferred. 

In event of the policyholder’s death before the policy matures, 
the insurance is payable immediately to the beneficiary. 

In addition to protecting beneficiaries, all life and endowment 
policies provide for a “savings fund” for the policyholder through 
the cash-surrender values. These values increase annually as 
premiums are paid. After a number of years the policyholder 
may withdraw the cash-surrender value. Of course, this termi¬ 
nates the policy, including the insurance protection for bene¬ 
ficiaries. 

Why Should Young People Insure? 

1. Because they are probably in good health, and can'pass the 
required medical examination now. 

2. Because the premium rates are lower than they ever will be 
again. 

3. Because insurance teaches habits of thrift so essential to 
their future success. 

4. Because insurance is a definite, systematic saving plan, re¬ 
quiring a fixed amount of annual savings. 

5. Because insurance is a safe plan. Every premium paid 
increases the guaranteed cash value, thus building up a fund 
available for later years.

215 


Life insurance provides: 

Money to pay off funeral expenses, debts, etc. 

Minimum monthly life income for wife. 

Extra monthly income for wife until children are grown. 

Funds for college education. 

A lump sum or a monthly life income for old age. 

A safe, systematic plan to accumulate money in 10 to 40 years, 
by means of an endowment. 

Business insurance provides money for the firm to compensate 
for loss of the brains and experience of a valuable partner or 
official.

Parcel Post 

The domestic parcel post offers a convenient, quick, and effi¬ 
cient means for the transporting of mailable parcels to any post 















These packages are being mailed to varioiLs parts of the 
world and will arrive safely via parcel post 


office in t^e United States and its possessions. This includes 
merchandise, farm and factory products, seeds, cuttings, bulbs 
roots,scions, and plants,commercial books (including catalogues)’ 
and miscellaneous printed matter weighing more than 8 ounces. 

Up to and mcluding 8 oz. is third-class matter, and the rate is liji 
lor each 2 oz. 


Weight and distance to be transported are considered in 

svstZ P“cel post, based on the zone 

system. The United States is divided into eight zones. These 
zones are as follows;

Postal Registration 

All valuable letters and parcels sent at letter rates should be 
registered. A return receipt for such mail may be obtained. 
Such letters and parcels must be presented to the post office or 
station for registration and not placed in a mailbox or mail drop. 

The registration system provides for the careful transmission 
of money and other valuable mail to any post office in the world, 
furnishing receipts to the mailer and providing for an indemnity 
in case of loss. 

The registration fee on a letter or parcel sent by first-class mail 
is based on a graduated scale, and it is in addition to the regular 
postage. The fee ranges from I5i to $1.00, covering an indemnity 
from $50 to $1,000. 

Air Mail 

Air-mail service costs 6(4 for each ounce or fraction of an ounce, 
regardless of the distance it is to be sent. 




































222 APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 

Mail Insurance 

TJiird- or fourth-class mail may be insured against loss, rifling, 
or damage equivalent to its actual value or cost of repairs, up to 
$200 when mailed at and addressed, to any post office in the 
United States or its possessions, or on or to United States naval 
vessels, excepting the Philippine Islands, for which the limit is 
$ 100 . 

A return receipt for an insured parcel may be obtained by pay¬ 
ing an additional fee of Zi at the time of mailing. If a receipt is 
requested after a parcel is mailed, a fee of 5i is charged. 

Postal Savings 

Anyone ten years old or older may open a postal savings 
account in his or her name by depositing one or more dollars in 
any post office authorized to accept postal savings. 

Amounts less than $1.00 may be saved by purchasing postal- 
savings stamps at lOfi each. A savings card with ten savings 
stamps affixed will be accepted as a deposit of $1.00 in opening an 
account or it may be redeemed in cash. Postal-savings cards will 
be furnished free of charge at any post office. Inquire at the post 
office for further information. 

Special Delivery 

This means that second-class, third-class, and fourth-class mail 
all are given the same treatment as first-class mail in transit, in 
addition to the special delivery at the office of the addressee. The 
fees for special delivery are 15^, 25^, and 35fi in addition to 
regular postage according to weight and amount. Special delivery 
of first-class mail costs, in addition to regular postage, lOji up to 
2 lb.; 20|4, 2 to 10 lb.; and 25|l! for more than 10 lb. 

Special Handling 

Anyone desiruig “special-handling” service in transit (that is, 
first-class mail service), without thte "special delivery” at the 
office of the addressee, may do so by paying a fee of lOfi up to 2 
lb.; 15|i, 2 to 10 lb.; or 20(1 for more than 10 lb., depending on the 
weight.

Forwarding 

A person desiring to have mail forwarded should file with the 
postmaster a written and signed request giving his or her present 
address and the full address to which the mail is to be forv/arded, 
as well as specific information as to the time dui-ing wdiieh the 
order is to be observed. Convenient cards can be obtained from 
the post office or from the letter carrier. 

Return of Mail 

The sender’s name should always be placed in the upper left- 
hand corner of all mail (parcel post and all) to secure its return 
when it is not delivered. In the case of insured or registered mail, 
this precaution is absolutely necessary. The post office has special 
regulations whereby undeliverable mail is returned to the “Dead 
Letter Office” for disposition. 

Lack of Postage Penalty 

Thoughtless or willful short payment of postage on fir.st-class 
mail is penalized as follows; “All partly but not fully prepaid first- 
class matter which is short paid more than one rate (three cents) 
(local 2i) shall be rated with the deficient postage plus an addi¬ 
tional charge of one cent for each ounce or fraction thereof.

Chapter XVII 
BANKING 


OBJECTIVE: To gain « practical knowledge of the service banks 
render to business, to learn what a bank can do for you, and to learn 
how to use the service of banks. 

A bank, in the ordinary sense of the word, is an institution for 
the custody and lending of money. Thus it facilitates the ex¬ 
change and transmission of funds by checks, drafts, and other 
commercial instruments. This function in our financial system is 
a trust rather more public than private. 

The bank also acts as a guide to its clients in counseling sound 
business practice and advising against unwise credits and in¬ 
vestments. The possession of a bank account is an indication of a 
person’s financial responsibility, and, for this reason, it often 
serves as a reference. A person unfamiliar with banking need not 
hesitate to go to a bank to open an account or to seek any of the

services available. The officers and employees are always glad to 
explain the functions of the various departments of the hank. 

Often the first contact that a boy or girl has with a banlc is the 
opening of a savings account. Usually a savings account can be 
started with a deposit of $1.00. Parents often start an account for 
their small children and transact the business until the children 
are old enough to do it for themselves. 

Most banks now are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation which protects each depositor against loss up to a 
maximum of $5,000. 



A page in a savings-department bankbook 


The depositor is given a bankbook in which is kept an account 
of the deposits and which serves as a receipt for the amount de¬ 
posited. In case a bankbook is lost, the depositor must notify 
the bank immediately. 








You may place money in a bank dunng banking houTS, at -wbich time 
a hank teller makes a record of it in your bankbook. 


■When a person wishes to add to his account, he makes out a 
deposit slip, which is handed with the money to the teller who 
records the amount in the depositor’s bankbook, also called 
passbook. Money is withdrawn from checking accounts by check 
and from savings accounts by a receipt, a blank for which is 
furnished by the bank. 

Usually, on all sums of ten dollars or more, on savings accounts, 
interest is paid every six months on the first of June and De¬ 
cember or July and January. Amounts deposited during interest 
periods, if deposited during the first five calendar days in a month, 
ordinarily "draw interest from the first of the month. Amounts 
withdrawn between interest days do not draw interest. 

Money placed in a checking account does not draw interest but 
provides a safe and convenient method of paying bills and 
accounts.

A promissory note giving a bond as collateral security 


Another type of promissory note is one that is signed when 
stocks, bonds, real estate, etc., are given the bank as security. 
This is called collateral. The note is filled out similar to the one 
above and in addition lists the collateral given and states the 
agreement under which the collateral is left with the banlc. 


Keep Your Receipts 

One important advantage of paying bills by check is that the 
canceled check, which the bank returns to the depositor after it 
has been cashed, is a receipt or proof that the bill has been paid. 
A receipt or a canceled check ought to be kept on file for a reason¬ 
able length of time, as a protection to the one who has paid 















BANKING 


231 



A receipt similar to this can be issued in payment of a bill 


a bill or any other debt. Care must be taken to see that a receipt 
gives the amount, the date when paid, and the signature of the 
one who receives the payment. 


Serious trouble is caused by carelessness in this matter. Many 
bills have had to be paid a second and even a third time becnu.se 
the receipt was lost or mislaid. 

Printed forms are used by most business firms, but just the 
word “Paid,” followed by the date and signature of the one who 
receives the money, is sufficient. 

Bank Discount 

LESSON 209 

When anyone borrows money from a bank upon signing a 
promissory note, the bank deducts the interest from the face of 
the note or the principal. That is, if you want to borrow money 
for 30 days, or 60 days, etc., tlie bank figures the interest due for 
that length of time and deducts it from the amount you borrow, 
giving you the balance. If your note is paid before the time it is 
due, the interest you paid for the balance of the time is refunded 
to you. The interest charged by the bank is called the bank 
discount. The difference between the face of the note, or the 
principal, and the interest is called the proceeds. Interest is 
figured at a certain per cent per year. In banking loans a year 
equals 360 days.

Chapter XVII! 
ALGEBRA 


OBJECTIVE: To introduce you to the advantage oF algebra in solving 
problems in which an equation can be Formed and in developing 
general Formulas which can be used in solving individual problems. 

Algebra is a branch of mathematics which simplifies many of 
the problems which seem diflicult in arithmetic. When we think 
of algebra, we usually think of letters, such as o, x, y, etc. These 
letters are used just as you use numbers; you can add, subtract, 
multiply, and divide them. The following examples will give you 
a good idea of how the fundamental operations of arithmetic are 
performed and indicated in algebra. 


LESSON 211 

EXAMPLE: 
a + a = 2a. 

The 2a means 2 times a. In this case o may be any number. 
If a is 3 and we substitute 3 for o, the value of 2o is 2 X 3 which 
is 6. 

4a; + 3a: = 7*. x + y = x + y. 

5y -2y = iy. y - 2 = y - 2. 

fix • 2 = 12x. 

In algebra, a dot (•) above the line is used often in place of X 
to show multiplication. This avoids confusion with the x used 
as a tenn in the problem. 

X ■ X — x^. X • y = xy.

Simple Equations 

Word problems are made simple in algebra by tbe use of equa¬ 
tions. An equation is an expression of equality between two 
groups of operations (meaning addition, subtraction, multiplica¬ 
tion, or division) joined by an equal sign. 


lesson 213 

EXAMPLE: 

*+2=7+4 
or X — 2 = 2a: + 7 

To solve an equation, you must place all of the unknowns on 
one side and all of the knowns on the opposite side. This can be 
done by addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, but 
the same operation must be done on both sides of the equation. 


EXAMPLE: 

X + 2 = 7 + 4 

X + 2 — 11 

- 2 = - 2 

X = ® 

X + 2 = 11 

X = 11 - 2 

X = 9 


Complete any operations that you can 
on either side of the equal sign. 

Subtract 2 from both sides of the equa¬ 
tion because you want the unknown alone. 


CHECK: 

* + 2 = 7 + 4 
9 + 2 = 7 + 4 
11 = 11 


To check, substitute the value of x in 
the first line of the equation. If one 
side proves equal to the other, the value 
of X is correct. 


EXAMPLE: 

2x + 4 = 7 + 3 
2x + 4 = 10 
2x = 10 - 4 
2x = 6 

X = 3 


Complete as many operations as you can 


2x means 2 times x, therefore divide both 
sides by 2.

Chapter XIX 
GEOMETRY 


OBJECTIVE: To sive you a review and some practice in applying the 
rules and formulas for measuring lines, surfaces, and solids which you 
have learned in your study of arithmetic. 

The word geometry comes from two Greek words meaning “to 
measure the earth.” In the study of geometry, we compare lines, 
angles, surfaces, and solids, and characteristics of such figures as 
the circle, square, rectangle, parallelogram, and triangle. 

The rules, formulas, and problems in this chapter are such as 
you commonly find in arithmetic. They are contributions which 
geometry has made to arithmetic. 


LESSON 215 


Lines and Angles 



A vertical line is a straight line whose direction is 
toward the center of the earth, 

A horizontal line is parallel with the horizon. 

An oblique line is a straight line whose direction 
is neither vertical nor horizontal. 




Parallel lines are two or more lines in the same 
direction which will never meet. 

An angle is formed when two lines running in 
different directions meet. 

A right angle is one of the four equal angles 
formed by the intersection of two lines which are 
perpendicular to each other. 

An obtuse angle is greater than a right angle.

LESSON 517 

A square has 4 equal sides and 4 right 
j angles. 

_ A rectangle has 4 sides, the two opposite, 

being equal, and 4 right angles. 

Area = length X width. 

To multiply the length X the width, both 
must be expressed in the same unit of measure as in., ft., yd., rds. 
etc. A plot of land 1 ft. long and 1 ft.wide is equal to 1 sq. ft.; 1 
yd. X 1 yd. = 1 sq. yd.;3 ft. X 3 ft. = 9 sq. ft. = 1 sq. yd. (See 
tables in Chapter II.)

LESSON 219 

A solid is a body that occupies a definite amount of space. It 
has extension in three directions, length, 'width, and thickness. 
The sphere, cube, and cone are examples of solids. 

Volume is the space enclosed, measured by cubic units. 



The sphere is a solid whose surface is at all points 
equidistant from the center. 

F = 7 X-^XrXrXr. r — radius. 

F = If X r X r X r or t) = H- r3. 



The rectangular solid has six sides that are 
all rectangles. 

V = length X width X height or « = Iwh. 




The cube is a solid whose six sides are all equal 
squares; this means that the length, width, and 
height of a cube are all equal. 

V = hX hX h.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS FOR GIRLS 



A cylinder is a body bounded by a uniformly 
curved surface, its ends being equal and parallel 
circles. 


V ^^XrXrXhoTV = ^rn. 

(r means the radius of the circular base.) 



The cone is a solid with a circular base narrowing 
to a point at the top. Since the volume of a cone is 
equal to 5 the volume of a cylinder of the same base 
and height: 

7 = XrXrXAori; = |^rH. 

(r means radius of the circular base.) 


A solid is generally thought of as an object that is not hollow. 
•But if we were to hollow it out and fill it with a different sub¬ 
stance, we could still call it a solid. Since a solid occupies space, 
we can say that it has volume. Because a solid has 3 dimensions, 
volume is calculated in cubic feet or cubic yards. Volume is also 
- expressed in pints, quarts, or gallons when it concerns liquids. 


1. List a few solid objects of the types that are explained on

RATIO AND PROPORTION 


OBJECTIVE; To show you a simple means of solving a class of prob¬ 
lems that you have thought quite difficult if you have not learned the 
simple form of reasoning represented by ratio and proportion. 

LESSON 220 

Ratio is a comparison between two numbers of the same kind. 
One can compare the lengths of two books, the heights of two 
buildings, the number of pieces of cake, etc! 

If one book is 4 in. long and another 12 in., the .second is 3 times 
as long as the first. The ratio is 4 to 12. It can be written as 4:12 
or A which can be reduced to Therefore the ratio between 
the lengths is 1 to 8.

ratio is 60 ;75 or fy whicli is j when reduced.

RATIO AND PROPORTION 249 

LESSON 221 

When two ratios are equal, we have a proportion. A. proportion 
is often useful when we have three dimensions or terms in a prob¬ 
lem and wish to find the fourth. 

EXAMPLE: 

If a 12-ft. tree easts a 4-ft. shadow, how long is the shadow of 
a 6-ft. tree? 

The ratio of the 4 ft. of shadow to the 12 ft. of the tree is 4:12 
or i . 

The length of the shadow of the 6-ft. tree is an unknown 
quantity which we shall represent by x. The ratio of the x ft. of 

shadow to the 6 ft. of the tree is a: : 6 or - • 

6 

Forming an equation (called a proportion), we have 

X 

1 ; 3 = a: ; 6 (1 is to 3 as a: is to 6) or; I = - 
(one third equals x sixths). 

In the proportion 1 : 3 = a: : 6, the inside terms (3 and x) ere 
called the means; the outside terms (1 and 6) are called the ex¬ 
tremes. The product of the means equals the product of the 
extremes. 

Hence: 3x = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 3 we get, a: = 2. 

.'. The 6-ft. tree will cast a 2-ft. shadow. 

X 

Note: If you use the fractional form of the equation, a “ 0 * 

multiply the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of 
the other for your new equation, 3a: = 6; 

Make a proportion for each of the following problems and find 
the missing term. 

1. A book is 10 in. long and 5 in. wide. Find the width of a 
book that is 8 in. long if the two are proportional. 

2. If a family eats 2 loaves of bread in 3 daysi how long will 8
