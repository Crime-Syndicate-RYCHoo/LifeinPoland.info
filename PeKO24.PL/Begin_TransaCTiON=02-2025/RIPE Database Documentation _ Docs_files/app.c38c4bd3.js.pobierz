Some of this information is confidential between the RIPE NCC and the resource holder and some of it is publicly available. The RIPE Network Management Database, more often referred to as the RIPE Database, provides the public view of this data. Some of the management details for maintaining Internet resources in this database are also confidential, for example MD5 password hashes. The RIPE Database provides access to this private data for resource holders.\n\nThe RIPE Database holds data for three separate registries:\n\n * RIPE Internet Number Registry (RIPE INR)\n * RIPE Internet Routing Registry (RIPE IRR)\n * Reverse Delegation and ENUM Registry\n\nThese could be three independent databases, however the information in each of them is related to each other. It was therefore decided to integrate the three registries into one logical database. In practise, it is also one physical database.\n\n\n# Purpose of the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE Database contains information for the following purposes:\n\n * Ensuring the uniqueness of Internet number resource usage through registration of information related to the resources and their Registrants and Maintainers (RIPE INR)\n * To provide accurate registration information of these resources in order to meet a variety of operational requirements\n * Publishing routing policies by network operators (RIPE IRR)\n * Facilitating coordination between network operators (network problem resolution, outage notification etc.)\n * Provisioning of Reverse Domain Name System (DNS) and ENUM delegations\n * Scientific research into network operations and topology\n * Providing information to parties involved in disputes over Internet number resource registrations to parties who are legally authorised to receive such information.\n\n\n# RIPE Internet Number Registry\n\nGlobal Internet resources are allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). The RIPE Internet Number Registry (RIPE INR) contains details of the Internet resources managed by the RIPE NCC within the RIPE NCC service region. These details in the RIPE Database are maintained jointly by the RIPE NCC and the Registrants of those resources. The RIPE INR also contains details of sub-allocations and assignments made from these resources by the Registrants. This information is maintained in the RIPE Database by the Registrants of those resources.\n\nThe information includes the organisations that hold the resources, where the allocations were made, and contact details for the networks. Dates of when changes were made to this information are also included, and some of the historical information is also available.\n\n\n# The RIPE Internet Routing Registry\n\nThe RIPE Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is part of a global distribution of databases by which network operators can publish their routing policies and their routing announcements so that other network operators can make use of the data. In addition to making Internet topology visible, the IRR is used by network operators to look up peering agreements, determine optimal policies, and more recently, to configure their routers.\n\nEach RIR has its own IRR. There are also many independent IRRs, for example RADb. A resource holder can register their routing information in any of the IRR databases. Most of the larger IRRs mirror each others\' routing information. Therefore, it is only necessary to enter this information into one IRR.\n\nOnly resources allocated to the RIPE region can be registered in the RIPE IRR.\n\nThe benefits of the IRR are only realised when registered routing policies are kept up-to-date, and reflect routing announcements in the \'real world\'.\n\n\n# Reverse Delegation\n\n\n# What is Reverse Delegation?\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is a globally distributed Internet service. It provides name-to-number (forward) and number-to-name (reverse) translations, using defined client-server and server-server protocols. The DNS is a public service - any Internet user is freely able to query the DNS system for forward or reverse translations.\n\nReverse DNS delegations allow applications to map to a domain name from an IP address. Reverse delegation is achieved by use of the special domain names in-addr.arpa (IPv4) and ip6.arpa (IPv6).\n\nFor all IP address blocks that IANA allocates to the RIPE NCC, they also delegate the corresponding reverse DNS zones within the centrally administered \'in-addr.arpa\' and \'ip6.arpa\' zones.\n\nThe RIPE NCC also publishes \'zone fragments\'. These are the parts of zones managed by other parties - the other Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), who share zone management of early registration networks.\n\n\n# Reverse Delegation in the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE Database is used as the management database to produce the DNS zones RIPE Internet Number Resources. It can provide the information for each delegated IPv4 and IPv6 range registered in the reverse DNS.\n\nThe information is stored in routing policy specification (RPSL) format as domain objects. The name of each domain object is the reverse DNS zone under in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa or e164.arpa. The "nserver:" attributes in each domain object define the officially delegated DNS name servers- the “NS” in DNS zone contents.\n\n\n# Domain Names\n\nThe RIPE Database used to contain information about domain names for Top Level Domain Registries based in the RIPE NCC service region as well as a few other regions. These were all removed from the RIPE Database by the end of 2011. The RIPE Database now contains no information about forward domain names. Further information about domain names can be found on the IANA ccTLD web page.\n\n\n# Administration of Internet Resources\n\nIANA is responsible for ensuring the uniqueness of the full set of Internet resources. This includes the full range of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and the whole 32-bit Autonomous System (AS) Number range. IANA allocates blocks of these resources to each of the five RIRs for them to distribute to their members and end users.\n\nThe RIPE Database contains large placeholder allocation objects to represent the range of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that have been allocated by IANA to the RIPE NCC. Not all of this address space has been allocated yet by the RIPE NCC to LIRs or end users.\n\nThe RIPE Database also holds details of legacy Internet resources. "Legacy" is the term given to those Internet number resources that were distributed before (or outside of) the current system of hierarchical distribution by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Legacy Internet resources were transferred to the RIPE NCC from the IANA\'s central registry according to the location of their legal organisation contact at the time.\n\nLegacy address space represented in the RIPE Database is structured into an administrative hierarchy. For every legacy hierarchy in the RIPE Database there is one inetnum that sits at the top of the hierarchy. The RIPE NCC considers the holder of this inetnum as the top-level legacy resource holder. All more specifics to this object are considered to have some business or contractual or historical relationship with the top-level legacy resource holder.\n\nIt is intended that the RIPE Database must only hold information about IP addresses that the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible for. There may still be some historical data that needs cleaning up.\n\nThe full range of 32-bit AS Numbers are represented in the RIPE Database by the as-block objects. All ASNs assigned by the RIPE NCC are represented in the RIPE Database by aut-num objects.\n\nIt should be noted that the RIPE Database is part of the global Internet Routing Registry. It may contain route(6) objects relating to any address space. This does not indicate any authoritative or administrative control over these Internet resources by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThere is a link between the number registry and the routing registry in order to authorise the creation of these route(6) objects. As a result, the originating ASN must be represented in the RIPE Database. Because of this requirement, many aut-num objects have been created in the RIPE Database that are copies of ASNs that the RIPE NCC is not administratively responsible for. This can sometimes cause confusion when the copied aut-num object in the RIPE Database reflects different contact details or routing policy to the object held in the database of the authoritative RIR.\n\n\n# Mirrored Databases\n\nThe RIPE Global Resource Service (GRS) provides resource information mirrored from several other databases. These are held in physically separate databases but logically part of the RIPE Database service. They can be queried using several of the RIPE Database interfaces. The information is updated daily from the authoritative source.\n\nThe following databases are mirrored:\n\n * AFRINIC\n * APNIC\n * ARIN\n * JPIRR\n * LACNIC\n * RADb\n * (RIPE GRS)\n\nTo view the up-to-date list of mirrored databases, perform the following query:\n\nwhois.ripe.net -q sources\n\n\nBecause the RIPE NCC is bound by Dutch and European data privacy laws, we are obligated to remove all personal data received from other databases. This is either removed at the source or stripped out and deleted during the transformation process. THe RIPE NCC does not store any personal data from other registries. Where necessary, we create and reference dummy objects to keep data integrity intact.\n\nBefore importing the data we transform objects into RIPE RPSL syntax by carrying out the following steps:\n\n * Adding missing mandatory attributes\n * Wrapping unrecognised attributes with "remarks"\n * Creating dummy objects for missing data to keep referential integrity\n * Converting attributes values\n * All these transformations are marked by "End Of Line" comments in the objects\n\nTo use GRS from the web interface, select the appropriate radio button below the search box. When using telnet or the whois command line client, add the --resource flag to your query to query only the dummified GRS databases, or the -a flag to query all available databases, i.e. GRS sources and the original RIPE Database combined.\n\n\n\nUsing the API, you can specify one or multiple GRS source names as parameters, e.g. "source=arin-grs" or "source=arin-grs&source=apnic-grs". For more information, please refer to the documentation on Github.\n\n\n# Criteria for a Mirrored Database\n\nDatabases mirrored by the RIPE NCC must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nThe mirrored database must be:\n\n * Public\n * Large\n * Useful to users in the RIPE NCC service region\n\nThe RIPE NCC reserves the final judgement on mirroring a database.

History of the RIPE Database\n\n * Background of the RIPE Database\n * Versions of the RIPE Database\n\n\n# Background of the RIPE Database\n\nFrom the very first RIPE Meeting in 1989, the need for some sort of registry had been identified. In the early years of RIPE, this consisted of documenting the use of IPv4 address space in the RIPE region on a voluntary basis. The actual address space was not distributed by RIPE.\n\nFrom August 1992, the newly established RIPE NCC started distributing address space in its service region. Allocations made by the RIPE NCC have always been documented in the registry by the RIPE NCC and the Local Internet Registries (LIRs). The RIPE NCC address registry was set up to serve two purposes:\n\n 1. A comprehensive public record of the address space for which the RIPE NCC has administrative responsibility. This concerns both address space allocated by the RIPE NCC and address space allocated by others and transferred to the administrative responsibility of the RIPE NCC.\n 2. A comprehensive public recording of the current holders of the address space. With the exhaustion of IPv4 address space, there will be no more unallocated IPv4 address space. However, the need for an accurate registry will remain.\n\nTransparency and accountability about the administration of Internet number resources has always been very important. Publication of the registry is an essential element of this transparency and accountability. The registry plays an important part in the operational coordination between Internet operators. The Internet Routing Registry (IRR) was established in 1995. Its purpose is to ensure stability and consistency of the Internet-wide routing by sharing information between network operators.\n\nOriginally, the RIPE Database was used by many Domain Name Registries as their ccTLD authoritative registry database. For some of the larger ccTLD registries, the RIPE Database was not their authoritative database but held a lot of duplicated information from the Domain Registries. In some cases, it just held a top-level forward domain object and used a "refer:" attribute to re-direct any queries to their authoritative whois service. Because this was a mixed up and incomplete system, it was decided at RIPE 57 in October 2008 to remove all forward domain information from the RIPE Database. This was completed in January 2011.\n\n\n# Versions of the RIPE Database\n\nThe original first version of the RIPE Database no longer exists and we have no information about it.\n\nThe second version of the RIPE Database was written in PERL and used files to store the data rather than a database. The data was in the ripe-181 format. This version provided a clear separation of routing information from allocation details.\n\nVersion 3 was released in April 2001. In this version, the old RIPE Database ripe-181 format was converted to the new RPSL format. The software was written in C and the data was stored in a MySQL database.\n\nThe basic design of the data model is still the same now. Since its release several years ago, many additional features have been added. New object types were added in 2004, including the organisation object. When the RIPE NCC started to encourage the adoption of IPv6, theRIPE Database software was made fully compliant with IPv6 and additional object types were added for this: inet6num and route6.\n\nWeb forms were introduced for both queries and updates shortly after this version was released. These have been constantly revised over the years and are still subject to regular minor improvements and occasional major improvement.\n\nA RESTful API was introduced, which was deployed to production in 2013.\n\nThe software underwent a major re-factor, still in C, in 2004. It was totally rewritten in Java in 2012, for queries, and early 2013- for updates.

had been identified. in the early years of ripe, this consisted of documenting the use of ipv4 address space in the ripe region on a voluntary basis. the actual address space was not distributed by ripe.\n\nfrom august 1992, the newly established ripe ncc started distributing address space in its service region. allocations made by the ripe ncc have always been documented in the registry by the ripe ncc and the local internet registries (lirs). the ripe ncc address registry was set up to serve two purposes:\n\n 1. a comprehensive public record of the address space for which the ripe ncc has administrative responsibility. this concerns both address space allocated by the ripe ncc and address space allocated by others and transferred to the administrative responsibility of the ripe ncc.\n 2. a comprehensive public recording of the current holders of the address space. with the exhaustion of ipv4 address space, there will be no more unallocated ipv4 address space. however, the need for an accurate registry will remain.\n\ntransparency and accountability about the administration of internet number resources has always been very important. publication of the registry is an essential element of this transparency and accountability. the registry plays an important part in the operational coordination between internet operators. the internet routing registry (irr) was established in 1995. its purpose is to ensure stability and consistency of the internet-wide routing by sharing information between network operators.\n\noriginally, the ripe database was used by many domain name registries as their cctld authoritative registry database. for some of the larger cctld registries, the ripe database was not their authoritative database but held a lot of duplicated information from the domain registries. in some cases, it just held a top-level forward domain object and used a "refer:" attribute to re-direct any queries to their authoritative whois service. because this was a mixed up and incomplete system, it was decided at ripe 57 in october 2008 to remove all forward domain information from the ripe database. this was completed in january 2011.\n\n\n# versions of the ripe database\n\nthe original first version of the ripe database no longer exists and we have no information about it.\n\nthe second version of the ripe database was written in perl and used files to store the data rather than a database. the data was in the ripe-181 format. this version provided a clear separation of routing information from allocation details.\n\nversion 3 was released in april 2001. in this version, the old ripe database ripe-181 format was converted to the new rpsl format. the software was written in c and the data was stored in a mysql database.\n\nthe basic design of the data model is still the same now. since its release several years ago, many additional features have been added. new object types were added in 2004, including the organisation object. when the ripe ncc started to encourage the adoption of ipv6, theripe database software was made fully compliant with ipv6 and additional object types were added for this: inet6num and route6.\n\nweb forms were introduced for both queries and updates shortly after this version was released. these have been constantly revised over the years and are still subject to regular minor improvements and occasional major improvement.\n\na restful api was introduced, which was deployed to production in 2013.\n\nthe software underwent a major re-factor, still in c, in 2004. it was totally rewritten in java in 2012, for queries, and early 2013- for updates. the database backend was switched from mysql to mariadb in 2016.\n\nthis database software is also used, with some local modifications, by apnic and afrinic.',charsets:{},lastUpdated:"2024-01-05T14:12:09Z",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1704463929e3},{title:"Personal Data, Database Management and

It can immediately follow the colon, or spaces or tabs may be used to separate them. The format and content of a value is determined by the syntax definition for that attribute within that object type. The same attribute name may be used in more than one object type. Often, the syntax definition will be the same for an attribute regardless of which object type it is used in. For example, the "admin-c:" attribute appears in most object types with the same definition of its syntax. But sometimes the attribute may be defined in a different way in different object types. For example "status:" is used in inetnum, inet6num and aut-num objects. For each of these object types, "status:" has a different meaning with a different pre-defined set of values.\n\nThe value can contain some pre-defined keywords at any place within the value as determined by the syntax definition for that attribute within that object type. It can also contain references to other objects and free text. You can refer to other objects by using their primary key values. These references and the keywords have a precisely defined syntax. If the objects you refer to do not already exist in the database, you will see error messages and your update will fail. The free text has no syntax, but may only contain Latin-1 recognisable characters.\n\nSome attribute values may contain spaces and tab characters to help make the information easier to read, as long as the syntax definition allows it. Note that spaces work better than tabs, as tabs can display differently on different machines.\n\nIf an attribute is included in an object, it must have a value unless the value is defined as free text. Even generated attributes, if included in the object, must have a syntactically valid value. The software may change this value, however, if the value is missing there will be a syntax error.\n\n\n# Split Values\n\nIn most cases, a value can be split over multiple lines. Each continuation line must start with a space, tab or plus (+) in column zero. Continuation lines do not include the attribute name.\n\nAn object cannot have a blank line inside it because this would mark the end of the object. A blank continuation line must start with the ‘+\' sign in column zero.\n\nAn example of a correct continuation line:\n\naddress:  Singel 258\n+\n      Amsterdam \n\n\nNote the ‘+\' in column zero on the second, blank line.\n\nValues cannot be split in the first attribute, which defines the object type, or in the primary key attribute(s). If this is done, the software will re-combine these attributes into a single-line value. The update will not fail.\n\nWhen parsing an object, the software will internally recombine continuation line values into a single value for processing. The values from multiple lines are joined with a single space in-between them. Therefore, it is also not possible to split a value in the middle of a word or within any text string. The object is stored in the database with any valid split values.\n\n\n# End-of-line Comments\n\nIn most cases, an end of line comment can be added at the end of a value. These start with a hash (#) and continue until the end of the physical line (a newline character ‘\\n\'). If a value is split over several lines, any or all of the lines may include an end of line comment. You cannot continue the comment on another line- these comments always stop at the end of the line in which they start. An end of line comment cannot start at column 0. It is possible to add end of line comments on several consecutive lines, which together form a block of text. However, for long comments, it is better to use the "remarks:" attribute.\n\nadmin-c: dw-ripe  # these NIC Handles\ntech-c:  dw-ripe  # form a set of contacts\nzone-c:  dw-ripe  # for this object\n\n\nAny free form value cannot contain a hash (#) character, as this would be recognised as the start of a comment. Although the software does not process comments, in some situations it does strip off the comments before using the values.\n\nIf split values and end of line comments are used together, the software strips off the end of line comments before the split values are combined.\n\nEnd of line comments cannot be added to the first attribute value, which defines the object type, or to the primary key attribute(s) value. If this is done the software will strip them off. The update will not fail. These comments are also not allowed on the "source:" attribute value. If one is added here, the update will fail.\n\nLong, end of line comments or long, free form attribute values can cause problems. Some email clients automatically break lines at certain points. If your email client does this on an update message then your update will fail. It may not be obvious at first sight that this has happened. Fortunately, there are many other options for submitting updates if this problem occurs.\n\n\n# List Values\n\nSome attributes allow the value to be a list.

Some of them can be used in different ways. How you use them makes a big difference to the workload needed to maintain the data.\n\nThe RIPE Database is intended for those who have, or will soon have Internet resources. This database is a public registry with a well-defined purpose. See \'Purpose of the RIPE Database\' for more details. You can create many objects in the RIPE Database without any resources. But if these objects are not referenced by any resource object within a specified time period they will all be deleted. See the section on Garbage Collection for more details.\n\nResource holders using the RIPE Database need a basic set of objects:\n\n * organisation\n * role\n * person\n * mntner\n\nFor new members, this set of objects will be set up by the RIPE NCC as part of the new LIR process. How you use these objects will affect how much maintenance you need to perform later.\n\n\n# Using the Organisation Object\n\nThe organisation object was introduced in 2004, long after the RIPE Database data model was designed. The organisation object can make life easier in some situations.\n\nConsider all users as organisations, whether they are multinational companies, universities or individuals. To use the RIPE Database, each of these organisations needs a set of data objects that represent their business model. The organisation must have:\n\n 1. People who can be contacted\n 2. These people have defined roles in the business\n 3. These roles include responsibility for Internet resources\n 4. These resources need authorisation tokens to protect them\n 5. These tokens may need public keys.\n\nThis set of objects represents your organisation. When the organisation is an individual who has been assigned some PI space, they may need several objects in the database. Multinational companies may have many hundreds of thousands of objects.\n\nThe organisation object was introduced as a way of keeping track of these sets of objects. The idea is to put the organisational identity of the entity at the centre by defining its organisation object. The organisation\'s business model can then be mapped out by creating the objects from the list above as appropriate. Each of these objects can be directly linked to the organisation object using the "org:" attribute. Or for a simplified model, link the mntner objects using the "org:" attribute in each mntner object. All objects must be maintained, so there is an indirect reference back to the organisation object through the mntner objects.\n\nSome multinational companies may have a distributed business model with different parts of the organisation responsible for different parts of their network. In this situation additional organisation objects can be created. These objects can reference the main organisation object through their own "org:" attribute. This allows users to keep track of the entire company\'s data or the parts delegated to different sections of the company.\n\nBy using these "org:" references, bulk changes to data are very much simplified. Tools can be written and deployed more easily. New ideas can be rolled out quickly across an entire data set. The more structured you make your data, the more easily it is to automate processes.\n\nWhen the organisation object was first introduced there was some resistance to make references to it for fear of the public or competitors being able to map out their business. But now that there are so many ways to (inverse) query the data, it is not difficult to find all resources or customers of any organisation. If you don\'t set up your data in a structured way, the management of the data becomes more complicated.\n\nBasically the organisation object should be the centre of your presence in the RIPE Database. All your human resources and Internet resources and authentication tokens should hang off this central point.\n\n\n# Using the Role Object\n\nThe person and role objects are often said to be interchangeable:\n\n * They share the same name space in the RIPE Database, but names can be duplicated.\n * The NIC Handles are only unique across the two object types combined, so both object types can\'t exist with the same NIC Handle.\n * Either a role or person object can be used everywhere that requires a reference to a contact, with only a couple of exceptions where it must be one type or the other.\n\nHowever, these two objects have very different functions. A person object holds personal details about an individual. A role object should describe a business function or operational unit and may reference the individual people responsible for this activity. References to person objects are optional in the role object.\n\nUsing role objects makes large-scale changes easier. The principle is the same if you have ten objects or 10,000 objects in the database. However, problems most commonly occur when dealing with a very large number of objects.\n\nMany organisations create a large number of objects that directly reference a person object, and experience difficulties if this person leaves the company. The organisation may be responsible for many objects of different types, possibly with several different mntner objects protecting them, and finding them and getting all the authorisations right to change the references can easily become a problem.\n\nWorking within certain guidelines can help avoid this situation:\n\nOnly use a person object as a holder of personal information Only reference a person object in role objects Reference the role objects in all the other places where contact data is required If the person responsible for a business role or function changes, then it is only necessary to modify a few role objects to reference a different person object. All references to the role objects remain valid. The scale of the changes you need to make is very much reduced.\n\nEven if you have only a handful of objects in the database, it is good practice to do this. Your business may grow, and time restraints mean that you may not go back and change things until you absolutely have to do so. This is how these objects were designed for use, but as this practice was never enforced by software business rules, much of the database still makes direct references to person objects.\n\n\n# Abuse Details\n\nThe irt object (Internet Response Team) was introduced to identify a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) for handling serious network problems like DOS attacks. It was later modified to make it usable for more general abuse. But all the old ways of documenting abuse were also still available. Now with the introduction of "abuse-c:" this general abuse is moving away from the irt object again. After a data cleanup, the irt object will only be used for CSIRT teams again and should not be used to handle general abuse complaints.\n\nGeneral abuse is now handled by the organisation object. This should reference an abuse handling role object with an "abuse-c:" attribute. This role object must include an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. All RIPE NCC allocated address space and direct end user assignments, represented by inet(6)num and aut-num objects, should reference an organisation object directly. All more specific address space objects inherit this reference. The abuse handler for this address space and all the more specific address space to that specified by the inet(6)num object is determined by the referenced organisation object.\n\nThere is a query flag (-c) which will return the irt object, if one exists, for any specified inet(6)num object. There is also another query flag (-b) that will find the indirectly referenced role object, extract the "abuse-mailbox:" attribute and return brief details including the email address from the role object.\n\n\n# Who Maintains the Data?\n\nThis is one of those areas that some users don\'t pay much attention to, but it is one of the most important questions regarding the use of the RIPE Database. Anyone authorised to maintain your data can cause serious damage to your network, your business and the business of your customers if they make a mistake. Authorisation is an all or nothing concept. You cannot authorise someone to create and modify customer\'s details but not delete it, for example.\n\nFor details of the technical workings of authorisation see the section, \'Authorisation\'. This section is about how to set up who can authorise what.\n\nThe authorisation model is based on the mntner object. This is a box that holds credentials. There are different types of credentials with passwords, PGP certificates and single sign-on (SSO) usernames being the main ones. At the time of writing, these credentials don\'t need to match anyone who is registered in the RIPE Database with a person object. They are simply lists of credentials that can belong to anyone. It is therefore not possible for the database software to identify ‘who\' authorised an update. The introduction of SSO as a credential is a step in this direction.\n\nEvery object in the RIPE Database must now be protected by a mntner object referenced by a "mnt-by:" attribute. The mntner object is also protected by a "mnt-by:" attribute. Normally, this references itself.\n\nFor a small organisation with only a few objects in the database you may decide that you only need one mntner object. This is created with one or more credentials and maintains itself. Every object you create in the RIPE Database is maintained by this mntner object. The people whose credentials are in the mntner object all have equal and full control over all of your database objects. They can create, modify and delete anything. Because of the anonymous way credentials are used in the mntner object, the software cannot identify which credential made the update, only that a specific mntner object was used.\n\nFor larger organisations with potentially hundreds of thousands of objects in the database you may want to distribute authority to maintain data. How you distribute it depends on your business model. One example could be for a multi-national organisation with customers in different countries to partition your address space allocations by country. You could have a separate team managing the network in each country, each with their own mntner object. The "mnt-lower:" attribute on the partitioned allocations restricts control to those teams.\n\nAnother possibility is to have separate teams handling address space, reverse delegations and routing. This can be set up using the appropriate "mnt-xxx:" attributes. For example "mnt-routes:".\n\nYou may also want to control who can grant authority to manage your data. Normally a mntner object maintains itself. This means anyone who has a credential in that mntner object can also change the mntner object. So they can add another password so that another person can make changes. In a large organisation, you may want a security team to control the mntner objects. In this case you can create a mntner object for the security team. All other mntner objects are maintained by this security team mntner. Only the security team can then allow someone else authority to maintain some data by adding their credential to the appropriate mntner object.\n\n\n# How do I keep an audit trail of changes to my data?\n\nYou can use notifications to keep track of changes to your data. This section details how to set up who gets notified of what.\n\nThe \'Notifications\' section details the technical workings of notifications and how to set up who gets notified of what.\n\nThere are many ways to set up notifications. If you want to know everything, you should use the mntner objects. All of your data is maintained by one or more mntner objects. These objects have a mandatory attribute "upd-to:". This lets you know if someone is trying to hack into your data. Any update to objects maintained by this mntner object that fails on authorisation gets notified to this email address. There is also an optional attribute "mnt-nfy" in the mntner object. This notifies you of every successful update to any object maintained by this mntner object.\n\nMost people direct notifications to individuals in the organisation, which is adequate if those individuals want to know about changes to objects they have some responsibility for, or interest in. However, these emails are often missed, ignored or simply deleted. If there is an issue that results from a change made some time ago, the information you received about the change may have been lost.\n\nOne way to keep an audit trail of changes is to set up a specific email address that you can reference in all of your mntner objects, in both email attribute types. You can set up a script that monitors that email address and archives all emails to a log file or database. You then have an audit trail of changes made to your objects. One thing that is missing is the acknowledgement message. For email updates, this is only returned to the address that submits the update. For web form updates or RESTful API updates, there is no acknowledgement message sent anywhere. The response is returned to the web session. However, for all updates, the software still generates the human-readable acknowledgement message that is returned in response to an email update. This is logged internally in the RIPE NCC\'s update logs, but only sent to the user if the update was submitted by email. Without a copy of this acknowledgement message, it is not possible to have a complete audit trail of who did what and when they did it.',normalizedContent:'# how to organize your data\n\nthere are many different types of objects in the ripe database. some of them can be used in different ways. how you use them makes a big difference to the workload needed to maintain the data.\n\nthe ripe database is intended for those who have, or will soon have internet resources. this database is a public registry with a well-defined purpose. see \'purpose of the ripe database\' for more details. you can create many objects in the ripe database without any resources. but if these objects are not referenced by any resource object within a specified time period they will all be deleted. see the section on garbage collection for more details.\n\nresource holders using the ripe database need a basic set of objects:\n\n * organisation\n * role\n * person\n * mntner\n\nfor new members, this set of objects will be set up by the ripe ncc as part of the new lir process. how you use these objects will affect how much maintenance you need to perform later.\n\n\n# using the organisation object\n\nthe organisation object was introduced in 2004, long after the ripe database data model was designed. the organisation object can make life easier in some situations.\n\nconsider all users as organisations, whether they are multinational companies, universities or individuals. to use the ripe database, each of these organisations needs a set of data objects that represent their business model. the organisation must have:\n\n 1. people who can be contacted\n 2. these people have defined roles in the business\n 3. these roles include responsibility for internet resources\n 4. these resources need authorisation tokens to protect them\n 5. these tokens may need public keys.\n\nthis set of objects represents your organisation. when the organisation is an individual who has been assigned some pi space, they may need several objects in the database. multinational companies may have many hundreds of thousands of objects.\n\nthe organisation object was introduced as a way of keeping track of these sets of objects. the idea is to put the organisational identity of the entity at the centre by defining its organisation object. the organisation\'s business model can then be mapped out by creating the objects from the list above as appropriate. each of these objects can be directly linked to the organisation object using the "org:" attribute. or for a simplified model, link the mntner objects using the "org:" attribute in each mntner object. all objects must be maintained, so there is an indirect reference back to the organisation object through the mntner objects.\n\nsome multinational companies may have a distributed business model with different parts of the organisation responsible for different parts of their network. in this situation additional organisation objects can be created. these objects can reference the main organisation object through their own "org:" attribute. this allows users to keep track of the entire company\'s data or the

Description of Attributes Common to all Objects\n\n * "org:" – this optional attribute references the primary key, or id, of an organisation object that currently exists in the database. The referenced object contains details of the organisation that holds Internet resources or secondary objects to help manage resources in the RIPE Database or specifies business relations. This attribute is required on the inet(6)num objects with the following status values:\n   \n   * ALLOCATED-BY-RIR\n   * ALLOCATED PA\n   * ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\n   * ALLOCATED PI\n   * ALLOCATED UNESPECIFIED\n\n * "admin-c:" – this attribute is optional in some objects and mandatory in others. It references the primary key, or NIC Handle, of either a role or person object. It should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object. The reference must be the contact details of an on-site administrative contact. This contact may be a single person, or it may be a role within the organisation that more than one person takes on. These people may or may not be listed in the role object.\n\n * "tech-c:" – this attribute is optional in some objects and mandatory in others. It references the primary key, or Nic Handle, of either a role or person object. It should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object. The reference must be the contact details of a technical contact. This contact may be a single person, or it may be a role within the organisation that more than one person takes on. These people may or may not be listed in the role object.\n\n * "remarks:" – this optional attribute can be any free format text, within the allowable encoding. This attribute can even have a blank value and be used as a spacer to separate different parts of the information in an object. Some objects have very complex arrangements in their remarks with lots of formatting and style to create a layout that almost personalises their data. Keep in mind that it is data and the RIPE Database is not the best place to display ASCII art. The best advice on using remarks is to ‘keep it simple\'.\n\n * "notify:" – this optional attribute specifies an email address to which notifications of changes to an object will be sent. Only the email addresses from the "notify:" attribute values contained in ‘this\' object will be notified of changes to ‘this\' object. Only successful changes will be notified. Within the RIPE NCC, we can override this notification mechanism. For example, if the community agrees on a syntax change that affects many objects in the database, this change may be done as a bulk update by the RIPE NCC. In some cases, the RIPE NCC does not want to trigger hundreds of thousands or even millions of emails to be sent as part of the implementation of an agreed change.\n\n * "mnt-by:" – this mandatory attribute references the primary key, or name, of a mntner object that currently exists in the database. This mntner object\'s credentials must authorise any operations performed on the object that contains this attribute. The mntner object must exist in the database before it can be referenced in other objects. In some objects, the mntner object referenced in a "mnt-by:" attribute can have a range of additional powers. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'. When this applies, it will be stated in the object template descriptions.\n\n * "created:" – This attribute reflects when the object was created in the RIPE Database. Because a large number of objects were imported in bulk from a previous incarnation of the RIPE Database on 21 September 2001, the actual "created" time for these objects can be very difficult or impossible to find. Because ISO 8601 does not support an "undefined" notation, the following date and time is used: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\n\n * "last-modified:" – This attribute reflects when it was last changed. If an object has never been changed, the value of this attribute will be the same as the "created:" attribute. If an object was part of the bulk import on 21 September 2001 and has never been modified, the original import date and time was used for this attribute. This attribute will not be modified as a result of bulk changes, applied to the database by the RIPE NCC, that have no semantic meaning. An example of this is when an attribute is deprecated and removed from all objects containing it.\n\n * "source:" – The "source:" attribute should specify the authoritative registry where the object is registered. In the RIPE Database, all source values are set to ‘RIPE\'. The same value is used even when the object is a copy of a resource from another registry. The source may be appended with a software-generated end-of-line comment ‘# Filtered\'. This is not part of the stored data. It may be generated when the object is displayed, depending on the query flags used. (Note that users cannot add end-of-line comments to a source attribute. Please see \'End of Line Comments\' for more information.) For the RIPE TEST Database the source value is ‘TEST\' for all objects. This may also be appended with ‘# Filtered\'. For the Global Resource Service (GRS), the RIPE NCC mirrors several other resource databases. The source value reflects which of the mirrored databases returned the query result. For example ‘APNIC-GRS\' if the queried resource was found in the mirror of the APNIC Database.',normalizedContent:'# description of attributes common to all objects\n\n * "org:" – this optional attribute references the primary key, or id, of an organisation object that currently exists in the database. the referenced object contains details of the organisation that holds internet resources

It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name   Presence   Repeat     Indexed \naut-num:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup\nas-name:         mandatory  single    \ndescr:           optional   multiple  \nmember-of:       optional   multiple   inverse\nimport-via:      optional   multiple  \nimport:          optional   multiple  \nmp-import:       optional   multiple  \nexport-via:      optional   multiple  \nexport:          optional   multiple  \nmp-export:       optional   multiple  \ndefault:         optional   multiple  \nmp-default:      optional   multiple  \nremarks:         optional   multiple  \norg:             optional   single     inverse\nsponsoring-org:  optional   single     inverse\nadmin-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse\ntech-c:          mandatory  multiple   inverse\nabuse-c:         optional   single     inverse\nstatus:          generated  single    \nnotify:          optional   multiple   inverse\nmnt-by:          mandatory  multiple   inverse\ncreated:         generated  single\nlast-modified:   generated  single\nsource:          mandatory  single  \n\n\nThe aut-num object serves a dual purpose in the database. As part of the RIPE Internet Number Registry, it contains the registration details of an Autonomous System Number (ASN) resource assigned by the RIPE NCC. As part of an Internet Routing Registry, it allows routing policies to be published. It refers to a group of IP networks that have a single and clearly defined external routing policy, operated by one or more network operators – an Autonomous System (AS). This is the only primary object that crosses over between these two registries in the RIPE Database.\n\nBecause of this crossover between the two registries contained within the RIPE Database, authorisation for creation of route(6) objects can and must be provided by both the address space holder and the holder of the AS number. For more details, see the section \'Authorisation\'.\n\nThe number part of an ASN is a 32-bit number. Historically, these were 16-bit numbers. But when the pool of available numbers was running low, they were extended to 32 bits. In theory, there is no difference between a 16-bit ASN and a 32-bit ASN, except perhaps the size of the number. One is just a subset of the other. For technical reasons, some users still prefer a 16-bit ASN.\n\nThe primary key value will be in this format:\n\n‘ASn\' where ‘n\' is a 32-bit unsigned, number in the range 0: 4,294,967,295.\n\nLeading zeroes (AS065536) are not allowed and will be removed (AS65536) by the database software.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the AUT-NUM Object\n\n * "aut-num:" – the registered AS Number of the Autonomous System (AS) that this object describes. It must start with the two letters ‘AS\'.\n * "as-name:" – a symbolic name of the AS. Must be a single word of letters, numbers and the characters ‘-‘ and ‘_\'.\n * "descr:" - A short description related to the object.\n * "member-of:" - references a set object that this AS wants to be a member of. This membership claim must be acknowledged by a respective "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * "import:", "export:" and "default:" - specify the IPv4 routing policies of the AS.\n * "import-via:" and "export-via:" - specify routing policies regarding non-adjacent networks. These attributes help participants of Multi-Lateral Peering services to inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be applied towards other participants.\n * "mp-import:", "mp-export:" and "mp-default:" - specify IPv4, IPv6 and multicast routing policies.\n * "org:" – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. This is a required attribute in the aut-num object. If the "status:" value is ‘ASSIGNED\' then the object must have an "org:" attribute.\n * "sponsoring-org:" – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. This value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. If a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. The aut-num object in the RIPE Database will then be synchronised with the changes. A user cannot set, remove or change this value. An aut-num object can be created without this attribute. But the RIPE NCC can remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * "status:" – There are three different categories of aut-num objects in the RIPE Database. This generated "status:" attribute clearly shows which category an aut-num object belongs to. The categories are:\n   * ‘ASSIGNED\', - all AS Number resources assigned by the RIPE NCC\n   * ‘LEGACY\' - all legacy AS Numbers used within the RIPE region but not assigned by the RIPE NCC\n   * ‘OTHER\' – any aut-num that is not one of the above, typically a non-authoritative copy of an aut-num from another RIR region used for routing authentication in the RIPE Database A user cannot set, remove or change this value. It is determined from the status noted for this resource in the registry information and set by the software when the object is updated. An update to an aut-num object will never fail because of a missing "status:" attribute or incorrect value. The software will add or correct it. The status of an aut-num is only administrative. It does not affect the usage of an aut-num for any routing purpose or impact certification in any way.\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. If present, this overrides any existing reference on a referenced organisation object. This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “mnt-by:” – This attribute may have extra powers in addition to its default behaviour. In the absence of any “mnt-routes:” attributes, the mntner objects listed in the “mnt-by:” attributes can authorise the creation of route(6) objects originated by this AS number. For more details, see the section \'Authorisation\'.\n\n\n# Description of the DOMAIN Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the domain object. It lists all possible attributes allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence       Repeat       Indexed\ndomain:           mandatory      single       primary/lookup\ndescr:            optional       multiple\norg:              optional       multiple     inverse\nadmin-c:          mandatory      multiple     inverse\ntech-c:           mandatory      multiple     inverse\nzone-c:           mandatory      multiple     inverse\nnserver:          mandatory      multiple     inverse\nds-rdata:         optional       multiple     inverse\nremarks:          optional       multiple\nnotify:           optional       multiple     inverse\nmnt-by:           mandatory      multiple     inverse\ncreated:          generated      single\nlast-modified:    generated      single\nsource:           mandatory      single\n\n\nThe domain object is mainly for registering reverse delegations (number-to-name translations) in both the RIPE Database and the DNS zone files. The RIPE Database is used as the management database for producing the DNS zones. No forward domain names are stored in the RIPE Database. IANA provides information about forward domains.\n\nReverse DNS delegations allow applications to map to a domain name from an IP address. Reverse delegation is achieved by use of the special domain names in-addr.arpa (IPv4) and ip6.arpa (IPv6).\n\nThe domain object is also used for registering ENUM delegations using the domain name e164.arpa.\n\nFor IPv4 addresses, a dash is allowed in the fourth octet of the reverse address. This allows for reverse DNS delegations for address space that doesn\'t fall on octet boundaries as specified in RFC 2317. A dash is not allowed in any other octet. For example:\n\nIPv4 address range\n10.2.1.6 - 10.2.1.25\n\nreverse delegation\n6-25.1.2.10.in-addr.arpa\n\n\nThis is created in the RIPE Database as a single object, including the dash in the range. The DNS provisioning software handles the dash notation and propagates this delegation to the zone file. The range 0-255 is a special case and is not allowed in the fourth octet. Modification and deletion can be performed on this single object in the database. Any change is propagated into the zone file by the DNS provisioning software.\n\nReverse DNS zones in the RIPE Database do not allow child objects. From a DNS view, only the parent object is effective. Business rules in the database software check for hierarchies when a reverse domain object is being created. If either a less or more specific domain object already exists, the creation of the new object is rejected.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the DOMAIN Object\n\n * “domain:” - This is the reverse delegation address or range. It can be for IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or an ENUM phone number. If a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record.\n * “descr:” - A short description related to the object.\n * “zone-c:” - This attribute references the primary key, or NIC Handle, of either a role or person object. It should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object.\n * “nserver:” - The "nserver:" attributes in each domain object define the officially delegated DNS nameservers (the ‘NS\' in DNS zone contents). If a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record. The nameserver name can optionally be followed by an IPv4 or IPv6 address as a glue record.\n * “ds-rdata:” – This attribute holds information about a signed delegation record for DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In DNSSEC the Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record is created from a DNSKEY Resource Record by comparing it with the public key. The parent publishes the DS Resource Record. The "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the RDATA of the DS Resource Records related to the domain (as shown in the "domain:" attribute). ds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278BF194C29A812B33935BB2517E17D1486210FA The tools provided with BIND (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. Before an update, you can copy the DS Rdata into the attributes.\n\n\n# Description of the INET6NUM Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the inet6num object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence    Repeat     Indexed\ninet6num:         mandatory   single     primary/lookup key\nnetname:          mandatory   single     lookup key\ndescr:            optional    multiple  \ncountry:          mandatory   multiple  \ngeofeed:          optional    single\ngeoloc:           optional    single    \nlanguage:         optional    multiple  \norg:              optional    single     inverse key\nsponsoring-org:   optional    single    \nadmin-c:          mandatory   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:           mandatory   multiple   inverse key\nabuse-c:          optional    single     inverse key\nstatus:           mandatory   single    \nassignment-size:  optional    single    \nremarks:          optional    multiple  \nnotify:           optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:           mandatory   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:        optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-routes:       optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-domains:      optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-irt:          optional    multiple   inverse key\ncreated:          generated   single\nlast-modified:    generated   single\nsource:           mandatory   single\n\n\nAn inet6num object contains information on allocations and assignments of IPv6 address space resources. This is one of the main elements of the RIPE Internet Number Registry.\n\nHierarchy of INET6NUM Objects\n\nThe inet6num objects cover many different types of data in the RIPE Database. The policy on issuing IPv6 addresses in the RIPE NCC service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses. This policy has changed a number of times over the years and some of the data in the RIPE Database was set up under previous policy conditions. The following paragraphs try to outline how this physical data in the RIPE Database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nThey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object ::/0. This root object is there for data management reasons. It does not mean the RIPE NCC has any administrative authority over the whole IPv6 address space.\n\nThe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the blocks of address space that the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible for. Most allocations to members are from the placeholder objects. However, there are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object. All of these objects, from the root object down to and including the allocations to members, have the same status value of ‘ALLOCATED-BY-RIR\'. There are no differences in the status to distinguish between blocks allocated by IANA to the RIPE NCC and allocations made by the RIPE NCC to members. For this you need to look at the “mnt-lower:”. For the blocks allocated by IANA to the RIPE NCC, the “mnt-lower:” has a RIPE NCC mntner, or it has no “mnt-lower:” which defaults to the “mnt-by:”. For allocations made from these administrative blocks to members, the “mnt-lower:” has the member\'s mntner. Some objects also include remarks highlighting that they are allocations from IANA to the RIPE NCC.\n\nRIPE NCC also makes assignments to end users and TLD operators from the placeholder administrative objects. These are recognised by the “status:” and the “mnt-by:”. In most cases, these assignments will have the status ‘ASSIGNED PI\' or ‘ASSIGNED ANYCAST\'. Some of the earlier direct assignments still have the status ‘ASSIGNED\'. These can still be recognised, as they should have a RIPE NCC mntner as one of the joint “mnt-by:” attributes.\n\nWithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. They all have a placeholder object as their parent. All of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. Although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inet6num object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nThe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. These are jointly managed by the RIPE NCC and either the End User or the sponsoring organisation. The sponsoring organisation is a RIPE NCC member who handles the End User\'s administration for this resource with the RIPE NCC.\n\nAn assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. There can be no more specific objects. For the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. All objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the RIPE Database by the member organisation, not by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or the member can create an aggregation object with part of the allocation. Assignments of a fixed size will be made from this aggregation object. Finally, any part of the address space may be assigned to an End User. Again, the assignment is the lowest level, or an end point, for that part of the hierarchy. All of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the INET6NUM Object\n\n * “inet6num:” – This specifies a block of IPv6 addresses that the inet6num object presents. The block may be one or more addresses. Addresses can only be expressed in a prefix notation. The prefix is converted to a canonical format where necessary and an informational message will be returned to the user if this conversion is done. The format expresses addresses as a 128-bit number in hexadecimal groups of two bytes with colon separators between the groups . There is the possibility of using a shorthand notation for strings of consecutive zeros. Leading zeros from any two-byte group will be removed by the software. In this case, an informational message will be returned to the user.\n * “netname:” – This is a name given to a range of IP address space. A netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. The first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. It is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “country:” – This identifies a country using the ISO 3166 2-letter country codes. It has never been specified what this country represents. It could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company, where the server centre is based, or the home of the End User. Therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map IP addresses to countries.\n * "geofeed:" – Contains a URL referencing a CSV file containing geolocation data for the resource. The geofeed format is defined in RFC 8805.\n * “geoloc:” – The geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. Format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. Latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. All more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “language:” – Identifies the language as a two-letter code from the ISO 639-1 language code list. All more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “org:” – single valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. This is a required attribute. In some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. If the inet6num object is (jointly) maintained by the RIPE NCC then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. If a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. The inet6num object in the RIPE Database will then be synchronised with the changes. A user cannot set, remove or change this value. An inet6num object can be created without this attribute. The software will generate the correct value if it is required. The RIPE NCC will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. If present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “status:” – The status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inet6num object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. It can not be changed after creating the object and it can take one of these values:\n   * ALLOCATED-BY-RIR – This is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible and allocations made to members by the RIPE NCC.\n   * ALLOCATED-BY-LIR – This is equivalent to the inetnum status ‘SUB-ALLOCATED PA\'. A member can sub-allocate part of an allocation to another organisation. The other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. However, the RIPE NCC member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if some parts of it have been sub-allocated to another organisation. Provisions have been built in to the RIPE Database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space. Within such allocation, it is still required to document assignments using the status "AGGREGATED-BY-LIR" or "ASSIGNED". With the inet6num object there is no equivalent to the inetnum ‘LIR-PARTITIONED\' status values allowing partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * AGGREGATED-BY-LIR – With IPv6, it is not necessary to document each individual End User assignment in the RIPE Database. If you have a group of End Users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /56, then you can create a large, single block with this status. The “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the End User blocks. All assignments made from this block must have that size. It is possible to have two levels of ‘AGGREGATED-BY-LIR\'. The "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inet6num object has been created.\n   * ASSIGNED – These are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an End User.\n   * ASSIGNED PI – These are assignments made by the RIPE NCC directly to an End User. In most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the End User. The sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the RIPE Database for the End User.\n   * ASSIGNED ANYCAST – This address space has been assigned for use in TLD anycast networks.\n * “assignment-size:” – This specifies the common size of all individual assignments aggregated into one block with the status ‘AGGREGATED-BY-LIR\'. This attribute is required to be present if the inet6num object has this status. The individual assignments do not need to be represented in the RIPE Database. But one or more assignments may be included if the member wishes to specify them for any reason. The maximum assignment size is 128.\n * “mnt-lower:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the inet6num with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-domains:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inet6num with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. Depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inet6num and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-routes:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route6 object creation. Authorisation for route6 object creation is the most complex. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-irt:” – Despite its name, this attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. It references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. Authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. These references apply in a hierarchical way. So where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inet6num object inherit the reference.\n\n\n# Description of the INETNUM Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the inetnum object. It lists all possible attributes allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence   Repeat     Indexed\ninetnum:          mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nnetname:          mandatory  single     lookup key\ndescr:            optional   multiple  \ncountry:          mandatory  multiple  \ngeofeed:          optional   single\ngeoloc:           optional   single    \nlanguage:         optional   multiple  \norg:              optional   single     inverse key\nsponsoring-org:   optional   single    \nadmin-c:          mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nabuse-c:          optional   single     inverse key\nstatus:           mandatory  single    \nassignment-size:  optional   single \nremarks:          optional   multiple  \nnotify:           optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:        optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-routes:       optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-domains:      optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-irt:          optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:          generated  single\nlast-modified:    generated  single\nsource:           mandatory  single  \n\n\nAn inetnum object contains information on allocations and assignments of IPv4 address space resources. This is one of the main elements of the RIPE Internet Number Registry.\n\nHierarchy of INETNUM Objects\n\nThe inetnum objects cover many different types of data in the RIPE Database. The policy on issuing IPv4 addresses in the RIPE NCC service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses within the region. This policy has changed many times over the years. Some of the data in the RIPE Database was set up under previous policy conditions. The following paragraphs outline how this physical data in the RIPE Database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nThey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object 0/0. This root object is there for data management reasons. It does not mean the RIPE NCC has any administrative authority over the whole IPv4 address space.\n\nThe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the /8 ranges of address space that the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible for. There are also top-level legacy objects. These are outside the administrative control of the RIPE NCC but still used by resource holders within the RIPE NCC service region. These are generally smaller than a /8 but hierarchically on the same level. In other words, the root object is the parent of all the top-level legacy objects and these /8 placeholder objects. There may be other placeholder objects outside these /8 objects for historical reasons. These will be cleaned up at some point in the future. There are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object.\n\nThe different types of data can be recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. The root object and all the placeholder objects will have a status ‘ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\'. But some of the member allocations may also have this status. If it has this status and has a RIPE NCC mntner as the “mnt-lower:”, then it is an administrative block. All the legacy objects will have the status ‘LEGACY\'.\n\nThe RIPE NCC has directly issued address space to its members and End Users from the placeholder administrative objects. Again, these are recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. Most allocations to members have a status ‘ALLOCATED PA\'. But a few will also have the status ‘ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\'. They will all have the members mntner as “mnt-lower:”. The assignments made by the RIPE NCC will have a status ‘ASSIGNED PI\' or ‘ASSIGNED ANYCAST\'. An allocation can also contain a single assignment with the same prefix length as the allocation, this combined object has the status \'ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\'.\n\nWithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. They all have the placeholder objects as their parent. All of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. Although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inetnum object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nThe member allocation objects are partly managed by the RIPE NCC and partly by the member. Because of this joint management, there are two maintainers on the object as the “mnt-by:” - these are the RIPE NCC maintainer and the LIR\'s default maintainer. If no default maintainer is present yet, the LIR must select it on the LIR Portal account details page. After doing this, the default maintainer will be reflected on all existing and new objects that have joint responsibility. Business rules determine which attributes can only be changed by the RIPE NCC and which ones can be changed by the LIR.\n\nThe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. These are jointly managed by the RIPE NCC and either the End User or the sponsoring organisation. The sponsoring organisation is a RIPE NCC member who handles the End User\'s administration for this resource with the RIPE NCC.\n\nAn assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. There can be no more specific objects. For the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. All objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the RIPE Database by the member organisation, not by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or part of it can be sub-allocated to another organisation. Finally, any part of it may be assigned to an End User. Again, the assignment is the lowest level or end point for that part of the hierarchy. All of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\nThe top-level legacy objects are also jointly managed by the resource holder and the RIPE NCC. Some values in these objects have business rules preventing the resource holder from changing the values. All other parts of the object can be edited in the same way as any other object. Below the top-level legacy object, the resource holder can create as many levels of hierarchy as they wish. All the objects in this legacy hierarchy will have the same status value of ‘LEGACY\'. So it is not possible to identify, for example, sub-allocations or assignments in the legacy hierarchy by status.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the INETNUM Object\n\n * “inetnum:” – This specifies a range of IPv4 addresses that the inetnum object presents. The range may be one or more addresses.\n\nAddresses can be expressed in either range or prefix notation. If prefix notation is used, the software will convert this to range notation and an informational message will be returned to the user. The end address must always be greater than or equal to the start address.\n\nThe range notation expresses addresses as 32-bit whole numbers in dotted quad notation. Leading zeros from any quad will be removed by the software and an informational message will be returned to the user.\n\n * “netname:” – This is a name given to a range of IP address space. A netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. The first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. It is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n\n * “descr:” - A short description related to the object.\n\n * “country:” – This identifies a country using the ISO 3166-2 letter country codes. It has never been specified what this country represents. It could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company or where the server centre is based or the home of the End User. Therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map IP addresses to countries.\n\n * "geofeed:" - Contains a URL referencing a CSV file containing geolocation data for the resource. The geofeed format is defined in RFC 8805.\n\n * “geoloc:” - The geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. Format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. Latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. All more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “language:” - Identifies the language as a two-letter code from the ISO 639-1 language code list. All more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “org:” – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. This is a required attribute. In some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. If the inetnum object is (jointly) maintained by the RIPE NCC then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. This value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. If a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. The inetnum object in the RIPE Database will then be synchronised with the changes. A user cannot set, remove or change this value. An inetnum object can be created without this attribute. The software will generate the correct value if it is required. The RIPE NCC will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. If present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or * "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n\n * “status:” – The status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inetnum object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. It can take one of these values:\n   \n   * ‘ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\' – This is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible. Historically, a small number of allocations made to members have this status also.\n   * ‘ALLOCATED PA\' – These are allocations made to members by the RIPE NCC.\n   * \'ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\' - An allocation with a single assignment of the same prefix length.\n   * AGGREGATED-BY-LIR – It is not necessary to document each individual End User assignment in the RIPE Database. If you have a group of End Users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /24, then you can create a large, single block with this status. The “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the End User blocks. All assignments made from this block must have that size. It is possible to have two levels of ‘AGGREGATED-BY-LIR\'. The "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inetnum object has been created.\n   * ‘LIR-PARTITIONED PA\' – This is to allow partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * ‘SUB-ALLOCATED PA\' – A member can sub-allocate a part of an allocation to another organisation. The other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. However, the RIPE NCC member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if parts of it have been sub-allocated. Provisions have been built in to the RIPE Database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space.\n   * ‘ASSIGNED PA\' – These are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an End User.\n   * ‘ASSIGNED PI\' – These are assignments made by the RIPE NCC directly to an End User. In most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the End User. The sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the RIPE Database for the End User.\n   * ‘ASSIGNED ANYCAST\' - This address space has been assigned for use in TLD anycast networks.\n   * ‘LEGACY\' – These are resources that were allocated to users before the RIPE NCC was set up.\n\n * “mnt-lower:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one-level more specific (child) objects to the inetnum with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. This is explained in more detail in the section, \'Authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-domains:” - This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inetnum with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. Depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inetnum and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. This is explained in more detail in the section, \'Authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-routes:” - This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route object creation. Authorisation for route object creation is the most complex. This is explained in more detail in the section, \'Authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-irt:” - This attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. It references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. Authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. These references apply in a hierarchical way. Therefore, where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inetnum object inherit the reference. This is explained in more detail in the section on Abuse Handling.\n\n\n# Description of the ROUTE Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the route object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nroute:          mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple   \norigin:         mandatory  single     primary/inverse key\npingable:       optional   multiple   \nping-hdl:       optional   multiple   inverse key\nholes:          optional   multiple   \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nmember-of:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ninject:         optional   multiple   \naggr-mtd:       optional   single     \naggr-bndry:     optional   single     \nexport-comps:   optional   single     \ncomponents:     optional   single     \nremarks:        optional   multiple   \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-routes:     optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single     \nlast-modified:  generated  single     \nsource:         mandatory  single     \n\n\nA route object contains routing information for IPv4 address space resources. This is one of the main elements of the RIPE Internet Routing Registry.\n\nEach interAS route (also known as an interdomain route) originated by an Autonomous System can be specified by using a route object for IPv4 addresses.\n\nAuthorisation for creating route objects is quite complex. There are multiple scenarios depending on who administers the address space. Because the RIPE INR and IRR are part of the same logical database, they can both be used for authorisation if the address space is RIPE NCC administered resources. For more details on this see the section, \'Authorisation\'.\n\nPlease refer to RFC 2622 for more information on the specific routing information attributes in the route object.\n\nThe route consistency can be checked using the AS routing consistency tool. This wizard compares the actual state of the Internet Routing tables (collected by RIS), in order to identify and correct possible inconsistencies in the RIPE Database.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ROUTE Object\n\n * “route:” – This specifies the IPv4 address prefix of the route. Together with the "origin:" attribute, these constitute a combined primary key of the route object. The address can only be specified as a prefix. It can be one or more IP addresses.\n * “descr:” - A short description related to the object.\n * “origin:” - AS Number of the Autonomous System that originates the route into the interAS routing system. The corresponding aut-num object for this Autonomous System may not exist in the RIPE Database.\n * “pingable:” - Allows a network operator to advertise an IP address of a node that should be reachable from outside networks. This node can be used as a destination address for diagnostic tests. The IP address must be within the address range of the route object containing this attribute.\n * “ping-hdl:” - References a person or role capable of responding to queries concerning the IP address(es) specified in the \'pingable\' attribute.\n * “holes:” – These attributes form a list of the component address prefixes that are not reachable through the aggregate route (that part of the address space is possibly unallocated).\n * “member-of:” – This attribute identifies a set object that this route object wants to be a member of. This membership claim, however, should be acknowledged by a corresponding "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * “inject:” – These attributes specify which routers perform the aggregation and when they perform it.\n * “aggr-mtd:” – This attribute specifies how the aggregate is generated.\n * “aggr-bndry:” – This attribute defines a set of Autonomous Systems, which form the aggregation boundary.\n * “export-comps:” – This attribute defines the set\'s policy filter, a logical expression which, when applied to a set of routes, returns a subset of these routes.\n * “components:” – This attribute defines the component routes used to form the aggregate.\n * “mnt-lower:” - Provides a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the route with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. This is only used if the parent route object does not contain an “mnt-routes:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-routes:” or “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. For more details see the section on authorisation.\n * “mnt-routes:” - Provides a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for exact match or more specific route object creation. For an exact match route object- if there is no “mnt-routes:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” is used. For a more specific route object the “mnt-lower may also be used, if present. The "mnt-routes:" attribute can include an optional list of prefix ranges inside curly brackets ("{}") or the keyword "ANY". This should follow the reference to the maintainer. The default, when no additional set items are specified, is "ANY" or all more specifics.\n\n\n# Description of the ROUTE6 Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the route6 object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nroute6:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \norigin:         mandatory  single     primary/inverse key\npingable:       optional   multiple  \nping-hdl:       optional   multiple   inverse key\nholes:          optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nmember-of:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ninject:         optional   multiple  \naggr-mtd:       optional   single    \naggr-bndry:     optional   single    \nexport-comps:   optional   single    \ncomponents:     optional   single    \nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-routes:     optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single \n\n\nA route6 object contains routing information for IPv6 address space resources. This is one of the main elements of the RIPE Internet Routing Registry.\n\nEach interAS route (also known as an interdomain route) originated by an Autonomous System can be specified by using a route6 object for IPv6 addresses.\n\nAuthorisation for creating route6 objects is quite complex. There are multiple scenarios depending on who administers the address space. Because the RIPE INR and IRR are part of the same logical database, they can both be used for authorisation if the address space is RIPE NCC administered resources. For more details on this see the section, \'Authorisation\'.\n\nThe route consistency can be checked using the AS routing consistency tool. This wizard compares the actual state of the Internet Routing tables (collected by RIS), in order to identify and correct possible inconsistencies in the RIPE Database.\n\nExample ROUTE6 object including all optional attributes:\n\nroute6:        fc00:600::/32\ndescr:         Route\norigin:        AS3333\nmnt-by:        CHILD-MB-MNT\ncomponents:    protocol BGP4 { 0:0:0:0:1:1:1:1/10^+}\n               protocol OSPF { 0:0:0:0:1:1:1:1/12^+}\ninject:        at 1.2.3.4 action pref=100; upon HAVE-COMPONENTS { 0:0:0:0:1:1:1:1/0, 0:0:0:0:1:1:1:1/0 }\ninject:        at rtrs-myset:AS2:rtrs-test:AS777234\ninject:        at AS777234:rtrs-myset:AS2:rtrs-test:AS7777234\ninject:        action community = {65535:295};\ninject:        action community = {65535:20};\ninject:        upon HAVE-COMPONENTS {::/8}\nexport-comps:  { fc00:600::/48 }\nholes:         fc00:600::/48, fc00:600::/56, fc00:600::/64\naggr-bndry:    AS771234:AS-mytest:AS3:AS-test:AS775234\naggr-mtd:      outbound AS771234:AS-mytest:AS3:AS-test:AS775234\nmember-of:     AS200200:rs-test\nmember-of:     AS3333:rs-test\nmnt-routes:    LIR-MNT { fc00:600::/36^+, fc00:600::/36^-, fc00:600::/16^36-48, fc00:600::/16^42, fc00:600::/56}\nmnt-routes:    LIR2-MNT      anY\ncreated:       1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\nlast-modified: 2012-01-01T15:30:45Z\nsource:        TEST\n\n\nPlease refer to RFC 2622 for more information on the specific routing information attributes in the route6 object.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ROUTE6 Object\n\n * “route6:” – This specifies the IPv6 address prefix of the route. Together with the "origin:" attribute, these constitute a combined primary key of the route6 object. The address can only be specified as a prefix. It can be one or more addresses.\n * “descr:” - A short description related to the object.\n * “origin:” - AS Number of the Autonomous System that originates the route into the interAS routing system. The corresponding aut-num object for this AS must already exist in the RIPE Database.\n * “pingable:” - Allows a network operator to advertise an IP address of a node that should be reachable from outside networks. This node can be used as a destination address for diagnostic tests. The IP address must be within the address range of the route6 object containing this attribute.\n * “ping-hdl:” - References a person or role capable of responding to queries concerning the IP address(es) specified in the \'pingable\' attribute.\n * “holes:” – These attributes form a list of the component address prefixes that are not reachable through the aggregate route (that part of the address space is possibly unallocated).\n * “member-of:” – This attribute identifies a set object that this route6 object wants to be a member of. This membership claim, however, should be acknowledged by a corresponding "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * “inject:” – These attributes specify which routers perform the aggregation and when they perform it.\n * “aggr-mtd:” – This attribute specifies how the aggregate is generated.\n * “aggr-bndry:” – This attribute defines a set of Autonomous Systems, which form the aggregation boundary.\n * “export-comps:” – This attribute defines the set\'s policy filter, a logical expression which when applied to a set of routes returns a subset of these routes.\n * “components:” – This attribute defines the component routes used to form the aggregate.\n * “mnt-lower:” - Provides a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the route6 with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. This is only used if the parent route6 object does not contain an “mnt-routes:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-routes:” or “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. For more details see the section \'Authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-routes:” - Provides a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for exact match or more specific route6 object creation. For an exact match route6 object- if there is no “mnt-routes:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” is used. For a more specific route6 object- the “mnt-lower may also be used, if present. The "mnt-routes:" attribute can include an optional list of prefix ranges inside curly brackets ("{}") or the keyword "ANY". This should follow the reference to the maintainer. The default, when no additional set items are specified, is "ANY" or all more specifics.\n\n\n# Description of the AS-SET Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the as-set object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nas-set:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple\nmembers:        optional   multiple  \nmbrs-by-ref:    optional   multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single \n\n\nTo specify policies, it is often useful to define sets of objects. An as-set object forms a set of AS Numbers that can be referenced in many of the places where an AS Number reference can be used. Sets can be built with hierarchical names and can also include direct references to other sets. References can also be made indirectly by using the “mbrs-by-ref:” attribute. For more details see the section about sets.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the AS-SET Object\n\n * “as-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘as-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be an as-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name have to be as-set names. For more details see the section on sets.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “members:” – These attributes list the direct members of the set. They can be either lists of AS Numbers, or other as-set names.\n * “mbrs-by-ref:” – These attributes can be used in all set objects. They allow indirect population of a set. If this attribute is used, the set also includes objects of the corresponding type (aut-num objects for as-set, for example) that are protected by one of these maintainers and whose "member-of:" attributes refer to the name of the set. If the value of a "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is ANY, any object of the corresponding type referring to the set is a member of the set. If there are no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the set is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes. For more details see the section about sets.\n * “mnt-lower:” – When creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present. Otherwise the “mnt-by:” mntner objects can be used for authorisation. For more details see the section about sets.\n\n\n# Description of the FILTER-SET Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the filter-set object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nfilter-set:     mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple\nfilter:         optional   single  \nmp-filter:      optional   single     \nremarks:        optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single \n\n\nTo specify routing policies, it is often useful to define sets of objects. A filter-set object defines a set of routes that match the criteria that you specify in your \'filter\' – in other words, it filters out the routes that you do not want to see. The policy filter can match routes using any BGP path attribute, such as the destination address prefix, AS-path, or community attributes. Although the “filter:” and “mp-filter:” attributes are ‘single\', they can be composite by using the operators AND, OR, and NOT.\n\nSets can be built with hierarchical names. Unlike other set objects the filter-set object does not include the “members:” or "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the FILTER-SET Object\n\n * “filter-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘fltr-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be a filter-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name must be filter-set names. For more details, see the section about sets.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “filter:” – This attribute defines the policy filter of the set. This is a logical expression which, when applied to a set of routes, returns a subset of these routes. These are the ones that you want to filter in or filter out. A filter-set object is required by business rules to include either a “filter:” or an “mp-filter:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n * “mp-filter:” – This attribute extends the "filter:" attribute to allow you to specify IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes and prefix ranges. A filter-set object is required by business rules to include either a “filter:” or an “mp-filter:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n * “mnt-lower:” – When creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present, otherwise they can be authorised by “mnt-by:” mntner objects. For more details see the section about sets.\n\n\n# Description of the INET-RTR Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the inet-rtr object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence     Repeat       Indexed\ninet-rtr:       mandatory    single       primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional     multiple  \nalias:          optional     multiple   \nlocal-as:       mandatory    single       inverse key\nifaddr:         mandatory    multiple     inverse key\ninterface:      optional     multiple   \npeer:           optional     multiple   \nmp-peer:        optional     multiple   \nmember-of:      optional     multiple     inverse key\nremarks:        optional     multiple   \norg:            optional     multiple     inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory    multiple     inverse key\ntech-c:         mandatory    multiple     inverse key\nnotify:         optional     multiple     inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory    multiple     inverse key\ncreated:        generated    single     \nlast-modified:  generated    single     \nsource:         mandatory    single     \n\n\nAn inet-rtr object specifies a router and its peering protocols with other routers. Canonical DNS name aliases can be set up as well as specifying which AS Number owns/operates the router.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the INET-RTR Object\n\n * “inet-rtr:” – This attribute is a valid DNS name of the router described by this object. It cannot end with a dot.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “alias:” – Each optional “alias:” attribute is a canonical DNS name for the router.\n * “local-as:” – This attribute specifies the AS Number of the AS which owns/operates this router.\n * “ifaddr:” - This attribute specifies the interface address and mask length within an Internet router, as well as an optional action to set other parameters on this interface.\n * “interface:” – This attribute specifies an interface address, This can be multi-protocol. It can have an optional action, examples being RPSL preferences, prepending and MED. Also an optional tunnel definition can be included.\n * “peer:” – This attribute specifies the details of any interior or exterior router peering. This can be specified using either an IP address of the peer router or its inet-rtr name. A group of peers can be specified using an rtr-set name or a peering-set name. If peering-set name form is used, only the peerings in the corresponding peering set that are with this router are included.\n * “mp-peer:” – This attribute extends the "peer:" attribute to support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n * “member-of:” - references a set object that this router wants to be a member of. This membership claim must be acknowledged by a respective "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n\n\n# Description of the PEERING-SET Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the peering-set object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute  Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed \npeering-set:     mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:           optional   multiple\npeering:         optional   multiple  \nmp-peering:      optional   multiple\nremarks:         optional   multiple  \norg:             optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:          mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nnotify:          optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:          mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:       optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:         generated  single\nlast-modified:   generated  single\nsource:          mandatory  single   \n\n\nTo specify routing policies, it is often useful to define sets of objects. A peering-set object defines a set of peerings that you specify in the “peering:” or “mp-peering:” attribute. It identifies all the peerings between a (set of) local routers and a (set of) peer routers. Although the “peering:” and “mp-peering:” attributes are ‘single\', they can be composite by using the operators AND, OR, and EXCEPT. EXCEPT is equivalent to ‘AND NOT\'.\n\nSets can be built with hierarchical names. Unlike other set objects the peering-set object does not include the “members:” or "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the PEERING-SET Object\n\n * “peering-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘prng-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be a peering-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name have to be peering-set names. For more details see the section \'Set Objects\'.\n\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n\n * “peering:” – This attribute defines a peering that you can use to import or export routes. A peering-set object is required by business rules to include either a “peering:” or an “mp-peering:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n\n * “mp-peering:” – This attribute extends the "peering:" attribute to allow you to specify IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes and prefix ranges. A peering-set object is required by business rules to include either a “peering:” or an “mp-peering:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n\n * “mnt-lower:” – When creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present, otherwise the “mnt-by:” mntner objects. For more details see the section \'Set Objects\'.\n\n\n# Description of the ROUTE-SET Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the route-set object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nroute-set:      mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple\nmembers:        optional   multiple  \nmp-members:     optional   multiple  \nmbrs-by-ref:    optional   multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single   \n\n\nA route-set object is a set of route prefixes and not a set of database route objects. Sets can be built with hierarchical names and can also include direct references to other sets. References can also be made indirectly by using the “mbrs-by-ref:” attribute. For more details see the section on Sets.\n\nWhere a route-set is expected (e.g. “members:” attribute of the route-set object), an AS number ASx defines the set of routes that are originated by ASx; and an as-set AS-X defines the set of routes that are originated by the ASes in AS-X. A route p is said to be originated by ASx if there is a route object for p, with ASx as the value of the “origin:” attribute.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ROUTE-SET Object\n\n * “route-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘rs-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be a route-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name have to be route-set names. For more details see the section on Sets.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “members:” – These attributes list the direct members of the set. They can be either address prefixes or ranges, other route-set names, lists of AS Numbers, or as-set names. An address prefix or a route-set name in a members attribute can be optionally followed by a range operator.\n * “mp-members:” – Extends the “members:” attribute to include IPv6 address prefixes.\n * “mbrs-by-ref:” – These attributes can be used in all set objects. They allow indirect population of a set. If this attribute is used, the set also includes objects of the corresponding type (aut-num, route-set or as-set objects for route-set, for example) that are protected by one of these maintainers and whose "member-of:" attributes refer to the name of the set. If the value of a "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is ‘ANY\', any object of the corresponding type referring to the set is a member of the set. If there are no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the set is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes.

internet number registry, it contains the registration details of an autonomous system number (asn) resource assigned by the ripe ncc. as part of an internet routing registry, it allows routing policies to be published. it refers to a group of ip networks that have a single and clearly defined external routing policy, operated by one or more network operators – an autonomous system (as). this is the only primary object that crosses over between these two registries in the ripe database.\n\nbecause of this crossover between the two registries contained within the ripe database, authorisation for creation of route(6) objects can and must be provided by both the address space holder and the holder of the as number. for more details, see the section \'authorisation\'.\n\nthe number part of an asn is a 32-bit number. historically, these were 16-bit numbers. but when the pool of available numbers was running low, they were extended to 32 bits. in theory, there is no difference between a 16-bit asn and a 32-bit asn, except perhaps the size of the number. one is just a subset of the other. for technical reasons, some users still prefer a 16-bit asn.\n\nthe primary key value will be in this format:\n\n‘asn\' where ‘n\' is a 32-bit unsigned, number in the range 0: 4,294,967,295.\n\nleading zeroes (as065536) are not allowed and will be removed (as65536) by the database software.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the aut-num object\n\n * "aut-num:" – the registered as number of the autonomous system (as) that this object describes. it must start with the two letters ‘as\'.\n * "as-name:" – a symbolic name of the as. must be a single word of letters, numbers and the characters ‘-‘ and ‘_\'.\n * "descr:" - a short description related to the object.\n * "member-of:" - references a set object that this as wants to be a member of. this membership claim must be acknowledged by a respective "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * "import:", "export:" and "default:" - specify the ipv4 routing policies of the as.\n * "import-via:" and "export-via:" - specify routing policies regarding non-adjacent networks. these attributes help participants of multi-lateral peering services to inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be applied towards other participants.\n * "mp-import:", "mp-export:" and "mp-default:" - specify ipv4, ipv6 and multicast routing policies.\n * "org:" – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. this is a required attribute in the aut-num object. if the "status:" value is ‘assigned\' then the object must have an "org:" attribute.\n * "sponsoring-org:" – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. this value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. if a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. the aut-num object in the ripe database will then be synchronised with the changes. a user cannot set, remove or change this value. an aut-num object can be created without this attribute. but the ripe ncc can remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * "status:" – there are three different categories of aut-num objects in the ripe database. this generated "status:" attribute clearly shows which category an aut-num object belongs to. the categories are:\n   * ‘assigned\', - all as number resources assigned by the ripe ncc\n   * ‘legacy\' - all legacy as numbers used within the ripe region but not assigned by the ripe ncc\n   * ‘other\' – any aut-num that is not one of the above, typically a non-authoritative copy of an aut-num from another rir region used for routing authentication in the ripe database a user cannot set, remove or change this value. it is determined from the status noted for this resource in the registry information and set by the software when the object is updated. an update to an aut-num object will never fail because of a missing "status:" attribute or incorrect value. the software will add or correct it. the status of an aut-num is only administrative. it does not affect the usage of an aut-num for any routing purpose or impact certification in any way.\n * “abuse-c:” – this attribute references an abuse contact object. if present, this overrides any existing reference on a referenced organisation object. this can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “mnt-by:” – this attribute may have extra powers in addition to its default behaviour. in the absence of any “mnt-routes:” attributes, the mntner objects listed in the “mnt-by:” attributes can authorise the creation of route(6) objects originated by this as number. for more details, see the section \'authorisation\'.\n\n\n# description of the domain object\n\nbelow is the object template for the domain object. it lists all possible attributes allowed in this object type.\n\nattribute name    presence       repeat       indexed\ndomain:           mandatory      single

dns zone files. the ripe database is used as the management database for producing the dns zones. no forward domain names are stored in the ripe database. iana provides information about forward domains.\n\nreverse dns delegations allow applications to map to a domain name from an ip address. reverse delegation is achieved by use of the special domain names in-addr.arpa (ipv4) and ip6.arpa (ipv6).\n\nthe domain object is also used for registering enum delegations using the domain name e164.arpa.\n\nfor ipv4 addresses, a dash is allowed in the fourth octet of the reverse address. this allows for reverse dns delegations for address space that doesn\'t fall on octet boundaries as specified in rfc 2317. a dash is not allowed in any other octet. for example:\n\nipv4 address range\n10.2.1.6 - 10.2.1.25\n\nreverse delegation\n6-25.1.2.10.in-addr.arpa\n\n\nthis is created in the ripe database as a single object, including the dash in the range. the dns provisioning software handles the dash notation and propagates this delegation to the zone file. the range 0-255 is a special case and is not allowed in the fourth octet. modification and deletion can be performed on this single object in the database. any change is propagated into the zone file by the dns provisioning software.\n\nreverse dns zones in the ripe database do not allow child objects. from a dns view, only the parent object is effective. business rules in the database software check for hierarchies when a reverse domain object is being created. if either a less or more specific domain object already exists, the creation of the new object is rejected.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the domain object\n\n * “domain:” - this is the reverse delegation address or range. it can be for ipv4 or ipv6 addresses or an enum phone number. if a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record.\n * “descr:” - a short description related to the object.\n * “zone-c:” - this attribute references the primary key, or nic handle, of either a role or person object. it should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object.\n * “nserver:” - the "nserver:" attributes in each domain object define the officially delegated dns nameservers (the ‘ns\' in dns zone contents). if a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record. the nameserver name can optionally be followed by an ipv4 or ipv6 address as a glue record.\n * “ds-rdata:” – this attribute holds information about a signed delegation record for dns security extensions (dnssec). in dnssec the delegation signer (ds) resource record is created from a dnskey resource record by comparing it with the public key. the parent publishes the ds resource record. the "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the rdata of the ds resource records related to the domain (as shown in the "domain:" attribute). ds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278bf194c29a812b33935bb2517e17d1486210fa the tools provided with bind (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. before an update, you can copy the ds rdata into the attributes.\n\n\n# description of the inet6num object\n\nbelow is the object template for the inet6num object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. required

internet number registry.\n\nhierarchy of inet6num objects\n\nthe inet6num objects cover many different types of data in the ripe database. the policy on issuing ipv6 addresses in the ripe ncc service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses. this policy has changed a number of times over the years and some of the data in the ripe database was set up under previous policy conditions. the following paragraphs try to outline how this physical data in the ripe database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nthey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object ::/0. this root object is there for data management reasons. it does not mean the ripe ncc has any administrative authority over the whole ipv6 address space.\n\nthe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the blocks of address space that the ripe ncc is administratively responsible for. most allocations to members are from the placeholder objects. however, there are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object. all of these objects, from the root object down to and including the allocations to members, have the same status value of ‘allocated-by-rir\'. there are no differences in the status to distinguish between blocks allocated by iana to the ripe ncc and allocations made by the ripe ncc to members. for this you need to look at the “mnt-lower:”. for the blocks allocated by iana to the ripe ncc, the “mnt-lower:” has a ripe ncc mntner, or it has no “mnt-lower:” which defaults to the “mnt-by:”. for allocations made from these administrative blocks to members, the “mnt-lower:” has the member\'s mntner. some objects also include remarks highlighting that they are allocations from iana to the ripe ncc.\n\nripe ncc also makes assignments to end users and tld operators from the placeholder administrative objects. these are recognised by the “status:” and the “mnt-by:”. in most cases, these assignments will have the status ‘assigned pi\' or ‘assigned anycast\'. some of the earlier direct assignments still have the status ‘assigned\'. these can still be recognised, as they should have a ripe ncc mntner as one of the joint “mnt-by:” attributes.\n\nwithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. they all have a placeholder object as their parent. all of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inet6num object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nthe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. these are jointly managed by the ripe ncc and either the end user or the sponsoring organisation. the sponsoring organisation is a ripe ncc member who handles the end user\'s administration for this resource with the ripe ncc.\n\nan assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. there can be no more specific objects. for the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. all objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the ripe database by the member organisation, not by the ripe ncc.\n\nthe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or the member can create an aggregation object with part of the allocation. assignments of a fixed size will be made from this aggregation object. finally, any part of the address space may be assigned to an end user. again, the assignment is the lowest level, or an end point, for that part of the hierarchy. all of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the inet6num object\n\n * “inet6num:” – this specifies a block of ipv6 addresses that the inet6num object presents. the block may be one or more addresses. addresses can only be expressed in a prefix notation. the prefix is converted to a canonical format where necessary and an informational message will be returned to the user if this conversion is done. the format expresses addresses as a 128-bit number in hexadecimal groups of two bytes with colon separators between the groups . there is the possibility of using a shorthand notation for strings of consecutive zeros. leading zeros from any two-byte group will be removed by the software. in this case, an informational message will be returned to the user.\n * “netname:” – this is a name given to a range of ip address space. a netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. the first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. it is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n * “descr:” – a short description related to the object.\n * “country:” – this identifies a country using the iso 3166 2-letter country codes. it has never been specified what this country represents. it could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company, where the server centre is based, or the home of the end user. therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map ip addresses to countries.\n * "geofeed:" – contains a url referencing a csv file containing geolocation data for the resource. the geofeed format is defined in rfc 8805.\n * “geoloc:” – the geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. all more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “language:” – identifies the language as a two-letter code from the iso 639-1 language code list. all more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “org:” – single valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. this is a required attribute. in some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. if the inet6num object is (jointly) maintained by the ripe ncc then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. if a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. the inet6num object in the ripe database will then be synchronised with the changes. a user cannot set, remove or change this value. an inet6num object can be created without this attribute. the software will generate the correct value if it is required. the ripe ncc will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * “abuse-c:” – this attribute references an abuse contact object. if present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . this can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “status:” – the status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inet6num object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. it can not be changed after creating the object and it can take one of these values:\n   * allocated-by-rir – this is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the ripe ncc is administratively responsible and allocations made to members by the ripe ncc.\n   * allocated-by-lir – this is equivalent to the inetnum status ‘sub-allocated pa\'. a member can sub-allocate part of an allocation to another organisation. the other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. however, the ripe ncc member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if some parts of it have been sub-allocated to another organisation. provisions have been built in to the ripe database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space. within such allocation, it is still required to document assignments using the status "aggregated-by-lir" or "assigned". with the inet6num object there is no equivalent to the inetnum ‘lir-partitioned\' status values allowing partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * aggregated-by-lir – with ipv6, it is not necessary to document each individual end user assignment in the ripe database. if you have a group of end users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /56, then you can create a large, single block with this status. the “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the end user blocks. all assignments made from this block must have that size. it is possible to have two levels of ‘aggregated-by-lir\'. the "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inet6num object has been created.\n   * assigned – these are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an end user.\n   * assigned pi – these are assignments made by the ripe ncc directly to an end user. in most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the end user. the sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the ripe database for the end user.\n   * assigned anycast – this address space has been assigned for use in tld anycast networks.\n * “assignment-size:” – this specifies the common size of all individual assignments aggregated into one block with the status ‘aggregated-by-lir\'. this attribute is required to be present if the inet6num object has this status. the individual assignments do not need to be represented in the ripe database. but one or more assignments may be included if the member wishes to specify them for any reason. the maximum assignment size is 128.\n * “mnt-lower:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the inet6num with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. if there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. this is explained in more detail in the section \'authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-domains:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inet6num with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inet6num and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. this is explained in more detail in the section \'authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-routes:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route6 object creation. authorisation for route6 object creation is the most complex. this is explained in more detail in the section \'authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-irt:” – despite its name, this attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. it references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. these references apply in a hierarchical way. so where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inet6num object inherit the reference.\n\n\n# description of the inetnum object\n\nbelow is the object template for the inetnum object. it lists all possible attributes allowed in this object type. required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nattribute name    presence   repeat     indexed\ninetnum:          mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nnetname:          mandatory  single     lookup key\ndescr:

inetnum object contains information on allocations and assignments of ipv4 address space resources. this is one of the main elements of the ripe internet number registry.\n\nhierarchy of inetnum objects\n\nthe inetnum objects cover many different types of data in the ripe database. the policy on issuing ipv4 addresses in the ripe ncc service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses within the region. this policy has changed many times over the years. some of the data in the ripe database was set up under previous policy conditions. the following paragraphs outline how this physical data in the ripe database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nthey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object 0/0. this root object is there for data management reasons. it does not mean the ripe ncc has any administrative authority over the whole ipv4 address space.\n\nthe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the /8 ranges of address space that the ripe ncc is administratively responsible for. there are also top-level legacy objects. these are outside the administrative control of the ripe ncc but still used by resource holders within the ripe ncc service region. these are generally smaller than a /8 but hierarchically on the same level. in other words, the root object is the parent of all the top-level legacy objects and these /8 placeholder objects. there may be other placeholder objects outside these /8 objects for historical reasons. these will be cleaned up at some point in the future. there are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object.\n\nthe different types of data can be recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. the root object and all the placeholder objects will have a status ‘allocated unspecified\'. but some of the member allocations may also have this status. if it has this status and has a ripe ncc mntner as the “mnt-lower:”, then it is an administrative block. all the legacy objects will have the status ‘legacy\'.\n\nthe ripe ncc has directly issued address space to its members and end users from the placeholder administrative objects. again, these are recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. most allocations to members have a status ‘allocated pa\'. but a few will also have the status ‘allocated unspecified\'. they will all have the members mntner as “mnt-lower:”. the assignments made by the ripe ncc will have a status ‘assigned pi\' or ‘assigned anycast\'. an allocation can also contain a single assignment with the same prefix length as the allocation, this combined object has the status \'allocated-assigned pa\'.\n\nwithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. they all have the placeholder objects as their parent. all of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inetnum object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nthe member allocation objects are partly managed by the ripe ncc and partly by the member. because of this joint management, there are two maintainers on the object as the “mnt-by:” - these are the ripe ncc maintainer and the lir\'s default maintainer. if no default maintainer is present yet, the lir must select it on the lir portal account details page. after doing this, the default maintainer will be reflected on all existing and new objects that have joint responsibility. business rules determine which attributes can only be changed by the ripe ncc and which ones can be changed by the lir.\n\nthe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. these are jointly managed by the ripe ncc and either the end user or the sponsoring organisation. the sponsoring organisation is a ripe ncc member who handles the end user\'s administration for this resource with the ripe ncc.\n\nan assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. there can be no more specific objects. for the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. all objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the ripe database by the member organisation, not by the ripe ncc.\n\nthe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or part of it can be sub-allocated to another organisation. finally, any part of it may be assigned to an end user. again, the assignment is the lowest level or end point for that part of the hierarchy. all of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\nthe top-level legacy objects are also jointly managed by the resource holder and the ripe ncc. some values in these objects have business rules preventing the resource holder from changing the values. all other parts of the object can be edited in the same way as any other object. below the top-level legacy object, the resource holder can create as many levels of hierarchy as they wish. all the objects in this legacy hierarchy will have the same status value of ‘legacy\'. so it is not possible to identify, for example, sub-allocations or assignments in the legacy hierarchy by status.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the inetnum object\n\n * “inetnum:” – this specifies a range of ipv4 addresses that the inetnum object presents. the range may be one or more addresses.\n\naddresses can be expressed in either range or prefix notation. if prefix notation is used, the software will convert this to range notation and an informational message will be returned to the user. the end address must always be greater than or equal to the start address.\n\nthe range notation expresses addresses as 32-bit whole numbers in dotted quad notation. leading zeros from any quad will be removed by the software and an informational message will be returned to the user.\n\n * “netname:” – this is a name given to a range of ip address space. a netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. the first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. it is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n\n * “descr:” - a short description related to the object.\n\n * “country:” – this identifies a country using the iso 3166-2 letter country codes. it has never been specified what this country represents. it could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company or where the server centre is based or the home of the end user. therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map ip addresses to countries.\n\n * "geofeed:" - contains a url referencing a csv file containing geolocation data for the resource. the geofeed format is defined in rfc 8805.\n\n * “geoloc:” - the geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. all more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “language:” - identifies the language as a two-letter code from the iso 639-1 language code list. all more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “org:” – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. this is a required attribute. in some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. if the inetnum object is (jointly) maintained by the ripe ncc then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. this value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. if a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. the inetnum object in the ripe database will then be synchronised with the changes. a user cannot set, remove or change this value. an inetnum object can be created without this attribute. the software will generate the correct value if it is required. the ripe ncc will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n\n * “abuse-c:” – this attribute references an abuse contact object. if present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or * "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . this can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n\n * “status:” – the status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inetnum object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. it can take one of these values:\n   \n   * ‘allocated unspecified\' – this is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the ripe ncc is administratively responsible. historically, a small number of allocations made to members have this status also.\n   * ‘allocated pa\' – these are allocations made to members by the ripe ncc.\n   * \'allocated-assigned pa\' - an allocation with a single assignment of the same prefix length.\n   * aggregated-by-lir – it is not necessary to document each individual end user assignment in the ripe database. if you have a group of end users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /24, then you can create a large, single block with this status. the “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the end user blocks. all assignments made from this block must have that size. it is possible to have two levels of ‘aggregated-by-lir\'. the "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inetnum object has been created.\n   * ‘lir-partitioned pa\' – this is to allow partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * ‘sub-allocated pa\' – a member can sub-allocate a part of an allocation to another organisation. the other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. however, the ripe ncc member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if parts of it have been sub-allocated. provisions have been built in to the ripe database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space.\n   * ‘assigned pa\' – these are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an end user.\n   * ‘assigned pi\' – these are assignments made by the ripe ncc directly to an end user. in most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the end user. the sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the ripe database for the end user.\n   * ‘assigned anycast\' - this address space has been assigned for use in tld anycast networks.\n   * ‘legacy\' – these are resources that were allocated to users before the ripe ncc was set up.\n\n * “mnt-lower:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one-level more specific (child) objects to the inetnum with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. if there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. this is explained in more detail in the section, \'authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-domains:” - this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inetnum with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inetnum and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. this is explained in more detail in the section, \'authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-routes:” - this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route object creation. authorisation for route object creation is the most complex. this is explained in more detail in the section, \'authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-irt:” - this attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. it references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. these references apply in a hierarchical way. therefore, where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inetnum object inherit the reference. this is explained in more detail in the section on abuse handling.\n\n\n# description of the route object\n\nbelow is the object template

Only the RIPE Database Administrators can create as-block objects. The set of as-block objects covers the full range of 16-bit and 32-bit AS Numbers. These objects prevent anyone other than the RIPE Database administrators from creating aut-num objects in the RIPE Database for AS Numbers that are administered by the RIPE NCC. The authorisation is set up so that anyone can create aut-num objects in the RIPE Database as copies of AS Numbers administered by other RIRs.\n\nThe primary key value will be in this format:\n\n‘ASn - ASm\' where n and m is a 32-bit unsigned, numbers in the range 0: 4,294,967,295. The values of n and m can be the same representing a block of one AS Number.\n\nLeading zeroes (AS1 - AS065536) are not allowed and will be removed (AS1 - AS65536) by the database software.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the AS-BLOCK Object\n\n * "as-block:" – the range of AS Numbers covered by this block.\n * "descr:" - A short description related to the object.\n * "mnt-lower:" – This attribute controls who is able to create aut-num objects in the RIPE Database for the range of AS Numbers covered by this as-block object. See the section \'Authorisation\' for more information.\n\n\n# Description of the IRT Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the irt object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name   Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nirt:            mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\naddress:        mandatory  multiple  \nphone:          optional   multiple  \nfax-no:         optional   multiple  \ne-mail:         mandatory  multiple   lookup key\nsignature:      optional   multiple  \nencryption:     optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nauth:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nirt-nfy:        optional   multiple   inverse key\nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single   \n\n\nThe irt object was introduced to represent a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). This object includes security information for use by CSIRT teams as they communicate with each other.\n\nThe irt object may only be referenced from inetnum and inet6num objects to show which CSIRT is responsible for handling computer and network incidents for that address range. Use is made of the hierarchical nature of address space. Any reference in an inet(6)num object to an irt object applies not only to the referencing object but also to all more specific address space. So the more specific objects inherit the reference to the irt object. When querying address space for an irt reference, the query software takes account of this inheritance and queries up the hierarchy looking for the nearest applicable irt object reference. This information is returned when any more specific inet(6)num object is queried. Where irt references are made at multiple points in an address space hierarchy, the closest less specific reference applies.\n\nAdding a reference to an irt object requires authorisation from the maintainer of the irt object. This is handled using the "auth:" attribute of the irt object. Although the reference to an irt object from an inet(6)num object is made using the "mnt-irt:" attribute, it should be clear that the irt object is not a mntner object. The irt object contains contact information and is more similar to a role object than a mntner object.\n\nThe contact details provided by an irt object must be business information and must not contain any personal information.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the IRT Object\n\n * "irt:" – This attribute is a single word name for the response team starting with ‘IRT-‘.\n * "address:" - This is a full postal address for the business contact represented by this irt object.\n * "phone:" – This is a phone number for the business contact represented by this irt object. It specifies a telephone number in international format. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally followed by an extension number.\n * "fax-no:" - This is a fax number for the business contact represented by this irt object.\n * "e-mail:" – This is an email address of a business role, organisation or CSIRT team represented by this irt object.\n * "signature:" – This attribute references a key-cert object in the RIPE Database representing a public key used by the CSIRT team to sign their correspondence.\n * "encryption:" – This attribute references a key-cert object in the RIPE Database representing a public key used to encrypt correspondence sent to the CSIRT team.\n * "auth:" – This attribute defines the authentication scheme to be used to authorise the addition of a reference to this irt object. It has the same authentication options as described in the the sub-section \'Description of the mntner Object\'.\n * "irt-nfy:" – This attribute specifies a business email address to be notified when a reference to this irt object is added or removed.\n * "mnt-ref:" – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this irt object in any other object.\n\n\n# Description of the KEY-CERT Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the key-cert object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nkey-cert:       mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nmethod:         generated  single    \nowner:          generated  multiple  \nfingerpr:       generated  single     inverse key\ncertif:         mandatory  multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single    \n\n\nA key-cert object holds a public key certificate, available by querying the RIPE Database. Anyone who needs to use authorisation in the RIPE Database and who has a private key can store their public key in a key-cert object. It is used with the mntner and irt objects. You cannot create a public/private key pair using the RIPE Database software. You must use some external software to create your keys and then copy the certificate data into the key-cert object.\n\nCurrently, the RIPE Database supports two types of keys, PGP and X.509.\n\nThe PGP certificate can be used to authorise updates to the RIPE Database and for signing and encrypting correspondence with a CSIRT using an irt object (see the sub-sections \'Description of the irt Object\' and ‘Description of the mntner Object\' for more details). The "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘PGP-nnnnnnnn\' where the key-id nnnnnnnn is a hexadecimal number. These keys are compliant with the Open PGP Message Format. PGP keys using an Elliptic Curve algorithm are not currently supported (e.g. Curve 25519, NIST, SECG, ECC Brainpool etc.).\n\nThe X.509 certificate can be used to sign and encrypt correspondence with a CSIRT using an irt object. It may work in some circumstances for authorising updates to the RIPE Database but we cannot guarantee this. The "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘X509-nnn\' where key-id nnn is an integer number starting with 1. If you want to create an X.509 key-cert object you must follow this appendix.\n\nThe "method:", "owner:" and "fingerpr:" attributes are all generated by the software. It is not necessary to include these attributes when you create or modify one of these objects. If any of them are supplied, the software will check the values. If the value is wrong for any reason, the software will replace the supplied values with generated values. In this case, a warning will be returned to the user.\n\nIn case of performing REST updates using this authentication method Client Certificate Authentication API needs to be used.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the KEY-CERT Object\n\n * "key-cert:" – This attribute specifies the key-id. This is used in "auth:" attributes of the mntner and irt objects.\n * "method:" – This attribute defines the type of the public key. Currently, only PGP and X509 are supported.\n * "owner:" – This attribute specifies the owner of the public key. This information must be supplied when you create the key. The RIPE Database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "fingerpr:" – This attribute is an identifier of the public key. The RIPE Database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "certif:" – The value of the public key should be supplied either using multiple "certif:" attributes, or in one "certif:" attribute. In the first case, this is easily done by exporting the key from your local key ring in ASCII-armored format and adding the string "certif:" to the start of each line of the key. In the second case, line continuation should be used to represent an ASCII-armored format of the key. All the lines of the exported key must be included, not forgetting the begin and end markers and the empty line that separates the header from the key body.\n\n\n# Description of the MNTNER Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the mntner object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nmntner:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nupd-to:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-nfy:        optional   multiple   inverse key\nauth:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:        optional   multiple   inverse key \ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single  \n\n\nObjects in the RIPE Database are protected using mntner objects. A mntner object is an anonymous box containing the credentials needed to authorise creation, deletion or modification of any objects that it protects by whomever maintains this data. Currently, these credentials are MD5 passwords or PGP keys or Single Sign-On user names from the RIPE NCC Access system. The syntax also allows for X.509 certificates, but these are not fully implemented throughout the whois software.\n\nObjects are protected by a mntner, if they contain a reference to the mntner in the object. This is done by including a "mnt-by:" attribute. Other "mnt-xxx:" attributes offer hierarchical protection. The "mnt-by:" attribute is mandatory in all object types.\n\nA mntner object can be referenced either as a single mntner or comma-separated list of mntners.\n\nMost users set the "mnt-by:" value in a mntner to reference itself. That makes it maintain itself. But this is not always the case. There are situations where someone wants to control who maintains a set of objects. This can be done by using mnt-a to maintain mnt-b. The object mnt-b contains the credentials to maintain a set of data. These credentials are set up by mnt-a.\n\nTo update an object protected by a mntner the authorisation must be passed from one of the "auth:" values in the mntner object referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes of the updated object. This means that the correct credential for one of the "auth:" values must be supplied as part of the update. If an object references more than one mntner in the "mnt-by:" attributes, they act as a logical \'OR\'. If the authorisation is passed by any "auth:" value from any of the referenced *mntner objects, then the update will be authorised.\n\nThe "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attributes all provide for hierarchical authorisation. These also work in a logical \'OR\' when multiple values are included in an object. How they are used is described in the object descriptions where these attributes are valid.\n\nFor more detailed information about using mntner attributes, see the section ‘Authorisation\'.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the MNTNER Object\n\n * "mntner:" – This attribute specifies the name of the mntner object. It should end in ‘-mnt\', but the software has never enforced this.\n * "descr:" – A short description related to the object.\n * "upd-to:" – This attribute specifies an email address where a notification will be sent when an attempt to update an object protected by this mntner is unsuccessful due to authorisation failure. If there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-nfy:" – This attribute specifies the email address where a notification will be sent when an object protected by this mntner is successfully updated. If there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-ref:" – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this mntner object in any other object.\n * "auth:" – This attribute defines an authentication scheme to be used. Any of the current authentication schemes used by the RIPE Database are allowed.\n\n\n# Description of the ORGANISATION Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the organisation object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence   Repeat     Indexed\norganisation:     mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\norg-name:         mandatory  single     lookup key\norg-type:         mandatory  single    \ndescr:            optional   multiple  \nremarks:          optional   multiple  \naddress:          mandatory  multiple \ncountry:          optional   single \nphone:            optional   multiple  \nfax-no:           optional   multiple  \ne-mail:           mandatory  multiple   lookup key\ngeoloc:           optional   single    \nlanguage:         optional   multiple  \norg:              optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:          optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:           optional   multiple   inverse key\nabuse-c:          optional   single     inverse key\nref-nfy:          optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:          mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nnotify:           optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:          generated  single\nlast-modified:    generated  single\nsource:           mandatory  single   \n\n\nThe organisation object provides information about an organisation that has registered an Internet resource in the RIPE Database. This may be a company, non-profit group or individual. It was introduced as a means to link together all of the human and Internet resources related to one organisation.\n\nThis object is the central starting point for managing data in the RIPE Database. All your other objects are related to this object. If you manage any aspect of any resource then you should have an organisation object so that other people know who you are, what you maintain and how to contact you.\n\nThe organisation object should only contain business information. Even if the organisation is an individual, it should not include any personal information.\n\nAdding references to an organisation object requires authorisation from the organisation. Removing them does not need any authorisation. The maintainer of the organisation object can choose to be notified when any reference is added or removed.\n\nThis object is created for new members by the RIPE NCC with "org-type: LIR". These objects are required to include an "abuse-c:" attribute referencing an abuse contact object.\n\nThe member organisation objects are partly managed by the RIPE NCC and partly by the member. Because of this joint management, with the RIPE NCC mntner as the "mnt-by:", these objects are locked out of normal updates by members. The parts that the member can change can only be edited in the LIR Portal Object Editors.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ORGANISATION Object\n\n * "organisation:" – This attribute specifies the ID of an organisation object. When creating an object, you must specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value of the attribute to "AUTO-1" or "AUTO-1<letterCombination>" ,so the database will assign the ID automatically. The ID will always start with the string ‘ORG-‘ prefix, followed by 2 to 4 letters, digits, a dash and the database source. If deleted, it is not possible to recreate an organisation object with the same ID.\n * “org-name:” – This attribute specifies the name of the organisation that this organisation object represents in the RIPE Database.\n * “org-type:” – This attribute specifies the type of the organisation. It takes one of the following fixed values. Uses can only create organisation objects with the type ‘OTHER\'. The rest of the values can only be set by the RIPE NCC.\n   * \'IANA\' – Only used for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n   * \'RIR\' – Only used for the five Regional Internet Registries\n   * \'NIR\' – This is for National Internet Registries (there are no NIRs in the RIPE NCC service region, but it is used by APNIC)\n   * \'LIR\' – This represents all the Local Internet Registries (the RIPE NCC members)\n   * \'WHITEPAGES\' – A little-used historical idea for people who have a ‘significant\' presence in the industry but who don\'t manage any resources in the RIPE Database.\n   * \'DIRECT_ASSIGNMENT\' – Used for organisations who have a direct contract with RIPE NCC\n   * \'OTHER\' – This represents all organisations that do not fit any of the above categories.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * "country:" - This is the country for the organisation. Can only be added, modified or removed by the RIPE NCC if the organisation is referenced from RIPE NCC (jointly) maintained resources.\n * “phone:” – This is a phone number for the business contact represented by this organisation object. It specifies a telephone number in international shorthand. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – This is a fax number for the business contact represented by this organisation object.\n * “e-mail:” – This is a business email address for the organisation represented by this object.\n * “geoloc:” – The geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. Format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. Latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180].\n * “language:” – Identifies the language as a two-letter code from the ISO 639-1 language code list.\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “ref-nfy:” – This attribute specifies an email address where a notification will be sent when a reference to an organisation object is added or removed. If there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * “mnt-ref:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this organisation object in any other object.\n * “address:” – This is a full postal address for the business contact represented by this organisation object.\n\n\n# Description of the PERSON Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the person object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence   Repeat     Indexed \nperson:           mandatory  single     lookup key\naddress:          mandatory  multiple  \nphone:            mandatory  multiple  \nfax-no:           optional   multiple  \ne-mail:           optional   multiple   lookup key\norg:              optional   multiple   inverse key\nnic-hdl:          mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nremarks:          optional   multiple  \nnotify:           optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:          optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:          generated  single\nlast-modified:    generated  single\nsource:           mandatory  single  \n\n\nThe person object provides information about a real person. The original intention was that this should only be used for contacts responsible for technical or administrative issues relating to Internet resources registered in the RIPE Database. However, the business model used by many resource holders is to also document End User customers who have been assigned a resource. One of its purposes is defined as a contact database for people who manage resources. It is not easy to distinguish between customers and contacts from the person object, unless it is documented in "remarks:". The person object is the only object in the RIPE Database that should contain any personal information. The "person:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. The name in the "person:" attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nThe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. For these objects the primary key is the "nic-hdl:" attribute. Both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. So it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. The two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. But it is not possible to convert one into the other. It is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nIf a person object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same NIC Handle. This rule was only introduced in 2009. Before that date, the NIC Handles could be re-used. Some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference NIC Handles. A person or role object in the database that currently has that NIC handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this NIC Handle in the historical reference.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the PERSON Object\n\n * "person:" – This attribute specifies the full name of the contact person. It must have at least two words in the name.\n * “address:” – This is a full postal address for the contact represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – This is a phone number for the contact represented by this object. It specifies a telephone number in international format. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number., optionally followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – This is a fax number for the contact represented by this object.\n * “e-mail:” – This is an email address for the contact represented by this object.\n * “nic-hdl:” – This attribute specifies the ID of a person object. When creating an object, you can specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value of the attribute to ‘AUTO-1\' or ‘AUTO-1<letterCombination>\', so the database will assign the ID automatically. If an AUTO ID is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-RIPE\'. If you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. For example DW-RIPE, DW-NL and DW are all valid NIC Handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this person object in any other object.\n\n\n# Description of the POEM Object\n\nBelow shows the object template for the poem object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\npoem:           mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \nform:           mandatory  single     inverse key\ntext:           mandatory  multiple  \nauthor:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  single     inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single  \n\n\nA poem object contains a poem that is submitted by a user. It has no operational use and reflects the humorous side of industry representatives.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the POEM Object\n\n * "poem:" – This attribute specifies the title of the poem.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “form:” – This attribute specifies the identifier of a registered poem type. These are set by the poetic-form objects.\n * “text:” – This attribute specifies the body of the poem. It must be humorous, but not malicious or insulting. It should be written in the style of the "form:".\n * “author:” – This attribute is the NIC Handle of the person who entered the poem.\n\n\n# Description of the POETIC-FORM Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the poetic-form object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\npoetic-form:    mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  single     inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single  \n\n\nA poetic-form object defines the supported poem types. A new ‘poetic form\' must be approved by the community ‘style council\'. For more details, contact the RIPE Database Working Group or RIPE NCC Customer Services.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the POETIC-FORM Object\n\n * "poetic-form:" – This attribute starts with "FORM-". It is followed by the name of an internationally recognised poetic format of humorous writing. For example, limerick or haiku.\n * “descr:” – This attribute describes the style of the poetic form, written in the form style. For example, if it is a FORM-LIMERICK, the description will be written as a limerick.\n * "mnt-by:" - The poetic-form object must contain a single "mnt-by:" attribute. The object must be maintained by RIPE-DBM-MNT.\n\n\n# Description of the ROLE Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the role object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nrole:           mandatory  single     lookup key\naddress:        mandatory  multiple  \nphone:          optional   multiple  \nfax-no:         optional   multiple  \ne-mail:         mandatory  multiple   lookup key\norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nnic-hdl:        mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nabuse-mailbox:  optional   single     inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single   \n\n\nA role object is similar to a person object. However, instead of describing a single person, it describes a role performed by one or more people. This might be a help desk, network monitoring centre, team of system administrators, etc. A role object is useful since often a person performing a specific function may change while the role itself remains.\n\nThe role object should only include business information about the role. It should not contain any personal information, although it can reference person objects. The original intention was that the role object should be used in every other object where contacts are referenced. The person object was only intended to be referenced by the role object. However, business rules were never built into the software to enforce this. As a consequence, the person and role objects have been used inter changeably in almost any situation where contacts are referenced. The "role:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. The name in the “role:” attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nThe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. For these objects the primary key is the “nic-hdl:” attribute. Both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. So it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. The two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. But it is not possible to convert one into the other. It is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nIf a role object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same NIC Handle. This rule was only introduced in 2009. Before that date, the NIC Handles could be re-used. Some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference NIC Handles. A person or role object in the database now with that NIC handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this NIC handle in the historical reference.\n\nReferences to person objects is optional. A help desk can be represented by a role object. The role contains all the details needed to contact the help desk. It may not be necessary to identify the individuals who make up a team to provide support. Anyone with a problem will contact the help desk and ‘someone\' will respond and provide support. Therefore, no person objects need to be referenced by this help desk role object.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ROLE Object\n\n * "role:" – This attribute specifies a name for the role. As this is business data rather than personal data, the structure of the “role:” value is similar to the “org-name:” in the organisation object.\n * “address:” – This is a full postal address for the role represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – This is a phone number for the role represented by this object. It specifies a telephone number in international shorthand. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally be followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – This is a fax number for the role represented by this object.\n * “e-mail:” – This is an email address for the role represented by this object.\n * “abuse-mailbox:” – The role object is the only place that this attribute should be used. It represents the email address to be used when someone wants to report abuse from an Internet resource. A role object with an “abuse-mailbox:” attribute can be referenced by an “abuse-c:” attribute in an organisation object. For more details see the section on Abuse Handling.\n * “nic-hdl:” – This attribute specifies the ID of a role object. When creating an object, you can specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value of the attribute to ‘AUTO-1\' or ‘AUTO-1<letterCombination>\', so the database will assign the ID automatically. If an AUTO ID is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-RIPE\'. If you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. For example DW-RIPE, DW-NL and DW are all valid NIC handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this role object in any other object.',normalizedContent:'# descriptions of secondary objects\n\n * description of the as-block object\n * description of the irt object\n * description of the key-cert

can create as-block objects. the set of as-block objects covers the full range of 16-bit and 32-bit as numbers. these objects prevent anyone other than the ripe database administrators from creating aut-num objects in the ripe database for as numbers that are administered by the ripe ncc. the authorisation is set up so that anyone can create aut-num objects in the ripe database as copies of as numbers administered by other rirs.\n\nthe primary key value will be in this format:\n\n‘asn - asm\' where n and m is a 32-bit unsigned, numbers in the range 0: 4,294,967,295. the values of n and m can be the same representing a block of one as number.\n\nleading zeroes (as1 - as065536) are not allowed and will be removed (as1 - as65536) by the database software.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the as-block object\n\n * "as-block:" – the range of as numbers covered by this block.\n * "descr:" - a short description related to the object.\n * "mnt-lower:" – this attribute controls

csirt teams as they communicate with each other.\n\nthe irt object may only be referenced from inetnum and inet6num objects to show which csirt is responsible for handling computer and network incidents for that address range. use is made of the hierarchical nature of address space. any reference in an inet(6)num object to an irt object applies not only to the referencing object but also to all more specific address space. so the more specific objects inherit the reference to the irt object. when querying address space for an irt reference, the query software takes account of this inheritance and queries up the hierarchy looking for the nearest applicable irt object reference. this information is returned when any more specific inet(6)num object is queried. where irt references are made at multiple points in an address space hierarchy, the closest less specific reference applies.\n\nadding a reference to an irt object requires authorisation from the maintainer of the irt object. this is handled using the "auth:" attribute of the irt object. although the reference to an irt object from an inet(6)num object is made using the "mnt-irt:" attribute, it should be clear that the irt object is not a mntner object. the irt object contains contact information and is more similar to a role object than a mntner object.\n\nthe contact details provided by an irt object must be business information and must not contain any personal information.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the irt object\n\n * "irt:" – this attribute is a single word name for the response team starting with ‘irt-‘.\n * "address:" - this is a full postal address for the business contact represented by this irt object.\n * "phone:" – this is a phone number for the business contact represented by this irt object. it specifies a telephone number in international format. it must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally followed by an extension number.\n * "fax-no:" - this is a fax number for the business contact represented by this irt object.\n * "e-mail:" – this is an email address of a business role, organisation or csirt team represented by this irt object.\n * "signature:" – this attribute references a key-cert object in the ripe database representing a public key used by the csirt team to sign their correspondence.\n * "encryption:" – this attribute references a key-cert object in the ripe database representing a public key used to encrypt correspondence sent to the csirt team.\n * "auth:" – this attribute defines the authentication scheme to be used to authorise the addition of a reference to this irt object. it has the same authentication options as described in the the sub-section \'description of the mntner object\'.\n * "irt-nfy:" – this attribute specifies a business email address to be notified when a reference to this irt object is added or removed.\n * "mnt-ref:" – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this irt object in any other object.\n\n\n# description of the key-cert object\n\nbelow is the object template for the key-cert object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nattribute name  presence   repeat     indexed\nkey-cert:       mandatory  single     primary/lookup

holds a public key certificate, available by querying the ripe database. anyone who needs to use authorisation in the ripe database and who has a private key can store their public key in a key-cert object. it is used with the mntner and irt objects. you cannot create a public/private key pair using the ripe database software. you must use some external software to create your keys and then copy the certificate data into the key-cert object.\n\ncurrently, the ripe database supports two types of keys, pgp and x.509.\n\nthe pgp certificate can be used to authorise updates to the ripe database and for signing and encrypting correspondence with a csirt using an irt object (see the sub-sections \'description of the irt object\' and ‘description of the mntner object\' for more details). the "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘pgp-nnnnnnnn\' where the key-id nnnnnnnn is a hexadecimal number. these keys are compliant with the open pgp message format. pgp keys using an elliptic curve algorithm are not currently supported (e.g. curve 25519, nist, secg, ecc brainpool etc.).\n\nthe x.509 certificate can be used to sign and encrypt correspondence with a csirt using an irt object. it may work in some circumstances for authorising updates to the ripe database but we cannot guarantee this. the "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘x509-nnn\' where key-id nnn is an integer number starting with 1. if you want to create an x.509 key-cert object you must follow this appendix.\n\nthe "method:", "owner:" and "fingerpr:" attributes are all generated by the software. it is not necessary to include these attributes when you create or modify one of these objects. if any of them are supplied, the software will check the values. if the value is wrong for any reason, the software will replace the supplied values with generated values. in this case, a warning will be returned to the user.\n\nin case of performing rest updates using this authentication method client certificate authentication api needs to be used.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the key-cert object\n\n * "key-cert:" – this attribute specifies the key-id. this is used in "auth:" attributes of the mntner and irt objects.\n * "method:" – this attribute defines the type of the public key. currently, only pgp and x509 are supported.\n * "owner:" – this attribute specifies the owner of the public key. this information must be supplied when you create the key. the ripe database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "fingerpr:" – this attribute is an identifier of the public key. the ripe database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "certif:" – the value of the public key should be supplied either using multiple "certif:" attributes, or in one "certif:" attribute. in the first case, this is easily done by exporting the key from your local key ring in ascii-armored format and adding the string "certif:" to the start of each line of the key. in the second case, line continuation should be used to represent an ascii-armored format of the key. all the lines of the exported key must be included, not forgetting the begin and end markers and the empty line that separates the header from the key body.\n\n\n# description of the mntner object\n\nbelow is the object template for the mntner object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nattribute name  presence   repeat     indexed\nmntner:         mandatory  single

single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single  \n\n\nobjects in the ripe database are protected using mntner objects. a mntner object is an anonymous box containing the credentials needed to authorise creation, deletion or modification of any objects that it protects by whomever maintains this data. currently, these credentials are md5 passwords or pgp keys or single sign-on user names from the ripe ncc access system. the syntax also allows for x.509 certificates, but these are not fully implemented throughout the whois software.\n\nobjects are protected by a mntner, if they contain a reference to the mntner in the object. this is done by including a "mnt-by:" attribute. other "mnt-xxx:" attributes offer hierarchical protection. the "mnt-by:" attribute is mandatory in all object types.\n\na mntner object can be referenced either as a single mntner or comma-separated list of mntners.\n\nmost users set the "mnt-by:" value in a mntner to reference itself. that makes it maintain itself. but this is not always the case. there are situations where someone wants to control who maintains a set of objects. this can be done by using mnt-a to maintain mnt-b. the object mnt-b contains the credentials to maintain a set of data. these credentials are set up by mnt-a.\n\nto update an object protected by a mntner the authorisation must be passed from one of the "auth:" values in the mntner object referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes of the updated object. this means that the correct credential for one of the "auth:" values must be supplied as part of the update. if an object references more than one mntner in the "mnt-by:" attributes, they act as a logical \'or\'. if the authorisation is passed by any "auth:" value from any of the referenced *mntner objects, then the update will be authorised.\n\nthe "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attributes all provide for hierarchical authorisation. these also work in a logical \'or\' when multiple values are included in an object. how they are used is described in the object descriptions where these attributes are valid.\n\nfor more detailed information about using mntner attributes, see the section ‘authorisation\'.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the mntner object\n\n * "mntner:" – this attribute specifies the name of the mntner object. it should end in ‘-mnt\', but the software has never enforced this.\n * "descr:" – a short description related to the object.\n * "upd-to:" – this attribute specifies an email address where a notification will be sent when an attempt to update an object protected by this mntner is unsuccessful due to authorisation failure. if there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-nfy:" – this attribute specifies the email address where a notification will be sent when an object protected by this mntner is successfully updated. if there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-ref:" – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this mntner object in any other object.\n * "auth:" – this attribute defines an authentication scheme to be used. any of the current authentication schemes used by the ripe database are allowed.\n\n\n# description of the organisation object\n\nbelow is the object template for the organisation object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object

organisation that has registered an internet resource in the ripe database. this may be a company, non-profit group or individual. it was introduced as a means to link together all of the human and internet resources related to one organisation.\n\nthis object is the central starting point for managing data in the ripe database. all your other objects are related to this object. if you manage any aspect of any resource then you should have an organisation object so that other people know who you are, what you maintain and how to contact you.\n\nthe organisation object should only contain business information. even if the organisation is an individual, it should not include any personal information.\n\nadding references to an organisation object requires authorisation from the organisation. removing them does not need any authorisation. the maintainer of the organisation object can choose to be notified when any reference is added or removed.\n\nthis object is created for new members by the ripe ncc with "org-type: lir". these objects are required to include an "abuse-c:" attribute referencing an abuse contact object.\n\nthe member organisation objects are partly managed by the ripe ncc and partly by the member. because of this joint management, with the ripe ncc mntner as the "mnt-by:", these objects are locked out of normal updates by members. the parts that the member can change can only be edited in the lir portal object editors.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the organisation object\n\n * "organisation:" – this attribute specifies the id of an organisation object. when creating an object, you must specify an "auto" id by setting the value of the attribute to "auto-1" or "auto-1<lettercombination>" ,so the database will assign the id automatically. the id will always start with the string ‘org-‘ prefix, followed by 2 to 4 letters, digits, a dash and the database source. if deleted, it is not possible to recreate an organisation object with the same id.\n * “org-name:” – this attribute specifies the name of the organisation that this organisation object represents in the ripe database.\n * “org-type:” – this attribute specifies the type of the organisation. it takes one of the following fixed values. uses can only create organisation objects with the type ‘other\'. the rest of the values can only be set by the ripe ncc.\n   * \'iana\' – only used for internet assigned numbers authority\n   * \'rir\' – only used for the five regional internet registries\n   * \'nir\' – this is for national internet registries

provides information about a real person. the original intention was that this should only be used for contacts responsible for technical or administrative issues relating to internet resources registered in the ripe database. however, the business model used by many resource holders is to also document end user customers who have been assigned a resource. one of its purposes is defined as a contact database for people who manage resources. it is not easy to distinguish between customers and contacts from the person object, unless it is documented in "remarks:". the person object is the only object in the ripe database that should contain any personal information. the "person:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. the name in the "person:" attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nthe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. for these objects the primary key is the "nic-hdl:" attribute. both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. so it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. the two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. but it is not possible to convert one into the other. it is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nif a person object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same nic handle. this rule was only introduced in 2009. before that date, the nic handles could be re-used. some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference nic handles. a person or role object in the database that currently has that nic handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this nic handle in the historical reference.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the person object\n\n * "person:" – this attribute specifies the full name of the contact person. it must have at least two words in the name.\n * “address:” – this is a full postal address for the contact represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – this is a phone number for the contact represented by this object. it specifies a telephone number in international format. it must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country

the contact represented by this object.\n * “nic-hdl:” – this attribute specifies the id of a person object. when creating an object, you can specify an "auto" id by setting the value of the attribute to ‘auto-1\' or ‘auto-1<lettercombination>\', so the database will assign the id automatically. if an auto id is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-ripe\'. if you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. for example dw-ripe, dw-nl and dw are all valid nic handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this person object in any other object.\n\n\n# description

describes a role performed by one or more people. this might be a help desk, network monitoring centre, team of system administrators, etc. a role object is useful since often a person performing a specific function may change while the role itself remains.\n\nthe role object should only include business information about the role. it should not contain any personal information, although it can reference person objects. the original intention was that the role object should be used in every other object where contacts are referenced. the person object was only intended to be referenced by the role object. however, business rules were never built into the software to enforce this. as a consequence, the person and role objects have been used inter changeably in almost any situation where contacts are referenced. the "role:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. the name in the “role:” attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nthe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. for these objects the primary key is the “nic-hdl:” attribute. both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. so it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. the two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. but it is not possible to convert one into the other. it is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nif a role object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same nic handle. this rule was only introduced in 2009. before that date, the nic handles could be re-used. some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference nic handles. a person or role object in the database now with that nic handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this nic handle in the historical reference.\n\nreferences to person objects is optional. a help desk can be represented by a role object. the role contains all the details needed to contact the help desk. it may not be necessary to identify the individuals who make up a team to provide support. anyone with a problem will contact the help desk and ‘someone\' will respond and provide support. therefore, no person objects need to be referenced by this help desk role object.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the role object\n\n * "role:" – this attribute specifies a name for the role. as this is business data rather than personal data, the structure of the “role:” value is similar to the “org-name:” in the organisation object.\n * “address:” – this is a full postal address for the role represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – this is a phone number for the role represented by this object. it specifies a telephone number in international shorthand. it must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally be followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – this is a fax number for the role represented by this object.\n * “e-mail:” – this is an email address for the role represented by this object.\n * “abuse-mailbox:” – the role object is the only place that this attribute should be used. it represents the email address to be used when someone wants to report abuse from an internet resource. a role object with an “abuse-mailbox:” attribute can be referenced by an “abuse-c:” attribute in an organisation object. for more details see the section on abuse handling.\n * “nic-hdl:” – this attribute specifies the id of a role object. when creating an object, you can specify an "auto" id by setting the value of the attribute to ‘auto-1\' or ‘auto-1<lettercombination>\', so the database will assign the id automatically. if an auto id is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-ripe\'. if you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. for example dw-ripe, dw-nl and dw are all valid nic handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this role object in any other

A question mark character ('?' or 0x3F) is used as a substitution character, if the character is outside the latin-1 character set.\n * The response should contain a warning, if conversion was necessary. known issue #291\n * Unrecognised encodings that cannot be converted to latin-1 will result in an unsuccessful operation.\n * To be absolutely certain of what was stored in the database, do a follow-up query.\n * The REST API response will be in UTF-8.\n * We recommend to use UTF-8 character encoding in all REST API requests, but restrict the content to valid latin-1 characters.\n\n\n# Update latency\n\nIt could take up to 10 seconds before an update becomes visible for lookup or search operations. For non-hierarchical object types (person, role, organisation,...), the typical latency is less than 1 second. For hierarchical objects types (inet(6)num, route(6), domain), it is about 3-5 seconds on average, up to 10 seconds maximum.\n\nA way to work around this limitation is to rely on the response of the muting operation in REST API (PUT, POST, DELETE). These all return the object as it appears in the database in their response body after the successful update. This object is never filtered or altered in any way.\n\nAny required passwords must also be supplied as part of the Uniform Resource identifier (URI) using the URI query parameter \"password=\". One parameter should be used for each password supplied. The pseudo attribute \"password:\" cannot be used in the HTTP request body. See \"Email Updates\" for more information.\n\n\n# Client Certificate Authentication\n\nClient Certificate Authentication is supported by our REST API. To use the client certificate service, you must have your own certificate: either from a certificate authority (CA) such as Let's Encrypt, or you can generate one yourself.\n\nThe key-cert object's client certificate status is validated by checking its notBefore and notAfter dates to ensure it is within its designated validity period. This involves comparing the current date against these dates: if the certificate is not yet valid (notBefore) or has expired (notAfter), it is considered invalid and an error is raised. This validation ensures that the certificate is only used within its valid time frame, maintaining secure and reliable authentication.\n\nAdditionally, signed updates are only considered valid for an hour after they are signed. After that the authentication will fail.\n\n\n# Examples\n\n * Create your own certificate:\n   * Generate the private key: openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048\n   * Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR): openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr\n   * Generate the self-signed certificate using the CSR: openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -signkey client.key -out client.crt\n * Example using curl and previous certificate:\n   * curl --cert client.crt --key client.key -X PUT --data

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representational_state_transfer. all the services are accessible via https. use of the whois rest api is governed by the ripe database terms and conditions\n\n\n# restful uri format\n\neach object in the ripe database has a unique locator uri, in the following format:\n\nhttps://rest.db.ripe.net/{source}/{objecttype}/{key}\n\nwhere:\n\n * source is the database source (e.g. ripe).\n * objecttype is the object type (e.g. inetnum)\n * key is the primary key(s)\n   * normally key is a single attribute value.\n   * use the nic-hdl attribute value for person or role object types.\n   * combine the route(6) attribute value and origin attribute value for route or route6 object types (e.g. route 193.0.22.0/23as3333).\n\n\n# environments\n\nenvironment   protocol

'https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/tp1-ripe?dry-run=true&password=...'\n\n\n# request / response encoding\n\nplease take into account the following points to avoid unexpected encoding behaviour:\n\n * objects are stored using the latin-1 (iso-8859-1) character set.\n * if the request character set is not latin-1, then the request body is converted to latin-1. a question mark character ('?' or 0x3f) is used as a substitution character, if the character is outside the latin-1 character set.\n * the response should contain a warning, if conversion was necessary. known issue #291\n * unrecognised encodings that cannot be converted to latin-1 will result in an unsuccessful operation.\n * to be absolutely certain of what was stored in the database, do a follow-up query.\n * the rest api response will be in utf-8.\n * we recommend to use utf-8 character encoding in all rest api requests, but restrict the content to valid latin-1 characters.\n\n\n# update latency\n\nit could take up to 10 seconds before an update becomes visible for lookup or search operations. for non-hierarchical object types (person, role, organisation,...), the typical latency is less than 1 second. for hierarchical objects types (inet(6)num, route(6), domain), it is about 3-5 seconds on average, up to 10 seconds maximum.\n\na way to work around this limitation is to rely on the response of the muting operation in rest api (put, post, delete). these all return the object as it appears in the database in their response body after the successful update. this object is never filtered or altered in any way.\n\nany required passwords must also be supplied as part of the uniform resource identifier (uri) using the uri query parameter \"password=\". one parameter should be used for each password supplied. the pseudo attribute \"password:\" cannot be used in the http request body. see \"email updates\" for more information.\n\n\n# client certificate authentication\n\nclient certificate authentication is supported by our rest api. to use the client certificate service, you must have your own certificate: either from a certificate authority (ca) such as let's encrypt, or you can generate one yourself.\n\nthe key-cert object's client certificate status is validated by checking its notbefore and notafter dates to ensure it is within its designated validity period. this involves comparing the current date against these dates: if the certificate is not yet valid (notbefore) or has expired (notafter), it is considered invalid and an error is raised. this validation ensures that the certificate is only used within its valid time frame, maintaining secure and reliable authentication.\n\nadditionally, signed updates are only considered valid for an hour after they are signed. after that the authentication will fail.\n\n\n# examples\n\n * create your own certificate:\n   * generate the private key: openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048\n   * generate the certificate signing request (csr): openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr\n   * generate the self-signed certificate using the csr: openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -signkey client.key -out client.crt\n * example using curl and previous certificate:\n   * curl --cert client.crt --key client.key -x put --data

They are still used by many people, although synchronous updates by the other methods now account for the majority of updates.\n\nEmail update messages must be in plain text and can be MIME-encoded. If encoded messages are multipart/signed, the signature part will be associated with the corresponding MIME text part. When an encoded message is received, the database software will take each valid MIME part (including any related signature part) and merge them into one update message. Please see section \'MIME Support\' for more information.\n\nPasswords needed for authorising the updates of all objects in the message must be included somewhere in the message. This is done with the pseudo-attribute "password:", for example:\n\npassword: some clear text\n\n\nThis "password:" pseudo-attribute can be placed anywhere in the message. One attribute is needed for each required password. If the message is MIME-encoded the passwords can be in any MIME part. When it is all merged into a single update message, all passwords found will apply to all objects in the update. Passwords can also be contained within the text part of a signed update message and apply to objects outside the signed part. All credentials will be extracted before any authorisation checks are made. The "password:" pseudo-attributes will be removed before any of the objects are processed. This ensures that they will never be considered as part of any object.\n\nAcknowledgements (ack) containing the result of the update are returned to the sender of the email based on the "Reply-to:" and "From:" fields in the email header. Notifications (notif) may also be sent based on email addresses found in the attributes within each object in the update message and the related mntner objects. See section on Notifications.\n\nTo submit an email update, send your email message to one of the following email addresses:\n\n * Email updates to the RIPE Database\n * Email updates to the TEST Database\n * Email updates to the RC Database\n\nThere is no limit on how many objects that can be included in an email update message, or MIME part. There is a maximum limit on the size of an email message, which is 40 MB.\n\nOnly one ack message is returned for each update message. However, there may be many notif messages generated for each object in the update. This can result in large numbers of emails sent out when an update contains many objects. The ack and all notifs are all sent out at the end of processing the whole update message. Your mail server needs to be able to handle large numbers of emails coming from a single source (@ripe.net), otherwise they may all get marked as spam. You should optimise the number of update messages and number of objects per update to suit your working practises.\n\n\n# MIME Support\n\nThe database software supports the MIME format. This means that you can cryptographically sign an update message using email agents that attach the signature in a separate MIME part, not in the body of the message. However, encryption of the text is not allowed. All update messages must be sent in plain text.\n\nNested signing of messages is possible, allowing an update message to be signed by one user, sent to another user who signs it again and submits the update.\n\nThe database software does not allow any scoping of authorisation within the message (for example, MIME parts where different passwords apply).\n\nIt is strongly recommended to keep MIME encapsulation simple. Complex MIME structures are more likely to generate errors.\n\nThe following rules apply when submitting updates using MIME encapsulation:\n\nThe software will recognise the following headers and take the appropriate actions:\n\n * multipart/signed\n * multipart/alternative\n * multipart/mixed\n * multipart/unknown\n * application/pgp-signature\n * application/x-pkcs7-signature\n * application/pkcs7-signature\n * text/plain\n\nAll other content-types are treated as text/plain.\n\nAfter extracting credentials and validating signatures, all MIME parts are merged together and treated as a single update message.\n\n\n# Subject Line Keywords\n\nThe subject line can have a special meaning in email update messages by using keywords. The available keywords, which are case-insensitive, are:\n\n * NEW\n * HELP\n * HOWTO\n\nOne way to use a keyword is to put the single keyword in the subject line of an email message, with NO other words. If any other word is found (for example, Subject: NEW objects) then none of the words will be treated as keywords. All words in the subject line will be reported in the acknowledgement reply as invalid keywords, along with a WARNING message. In this context, it is impossible to know if a word is meant as a keyword or just part of a comment.\n\nMany users often include their own references in the subject line. Using this method, it is not possible to also use a keyword. The user\'s references are reported in the WARNING message as invalid keywords.\n\nSome examples: Subject: new\n\nThis is an accepted keyword. Subject: sending my new objects\n\nNone of these words are accepted as a keyword and all reported in the warning message.\n\nUse the NEW keyword if you want the database to only accept new objects. In this case, all objects found in the update are assumed to be creation operations. If an object already exists in the database, that object will result in an error message in the acknowledgement. However, the remaining objects will still be processed.\n\nThe HELP keyword causes a piece of text to be returned in the acknowledgement that contains information about how to query and update the database. When this keyword is used the body of the update message, it is ignored. HOWTO performs the same action as the HELP keyword.',normalizedContent:'# email updates\n\nemail updates were the original method of updating the ripe database. they are still used by many people,

Currently, there are many other methods of submitting update information to the database. However, we still refer to an update as an update message.\n\nThe different ways of submitting the update message are described in section Email updates. The method that is used passes the data to an appropriate handler in the software. These handlers extract the one or more database objects from the update message along with any credentials, including passwords, PGP signatures and single sign-on session details. An object must start with one of the recognised object type attributes. These are described in section RPSL Object Types. The object ends with the first blank line found after the type attribute. This is technically defined as two consecutive new-line characters ("\\n\\n"). An object cannot contain a blank line. If a blank line is required for the visual representation of an object it must be either a "remarks:" attribute with no ‘value\' part or, if it is a continuation line of any attribute, it must start with a plus sign ("+"). See section Split Values for more details.\n\nWe apply a heuristic method to each paragraph of text in the update message to determine if it is an RPSL object. Any part of the message that is not recognised as an RPSL object is ignored. These ignored parts are grouped together at the end of the acknowledgement message.\n\nThe object(s) presented in the update message must each match one of the object templates described in section RPSL Object Types. These templates can be accessed in several ways. See section Accessing the Object Templates.\n\nEach instance of an object must contain at least one of each of the mandatory attributes for that object type. The optional attributes can be left out, unless the software business rules require them. If any of the optional attributes are included they must have a ‘value\' part, unless the value is defined as free text. Free text values can be blank.

Once you have the template, it can be copied into an email message or pasted into a web form or added into a script to generate objects. To create an object from the template, you must remove all the attribute lines that you do not want. For the remaining lines, you must replace the description with the value. Where an attribute is multiple, further lines can be added with additional values.\n\nWith some update methods the template is provided for you - for example, when using Webupdates. If you select to create a new object using field mode it presents a set of fields matching all the mandatory attributes for the selected object type. Optional attributes can be selected from a drop-down menu. More instances of any given attribute can be inserted. If you choose the text area mode, a list of all attributes is presented in the text area. The mandatory attributes are in upper case and the optional attributes are in lower case. Delete the optional ones you don't want to use.

The database software tries to process the objects one by one, starting with the first recognised object in the message. The order can matter, however, the database software has limited options for changing the order. The only condition the software can recognise is when an auto-generation process is used for certain object primary keys. "AUTO-n" primary key values can be included for generation and can also be referenced by other objects in the same update message. These will be resolved, as long as the number "n" is consistent and there are no circular references. If an object that references a value ‘AUTO-1\' is listed in the update message before the object where the value ‘AUTO-1\' is generated, the ordering will be changed. The referencing object will be pushed to the end of the list, by which time the object crating the ‘AUTO-1\' value will have been processed.\n\nThe below figure shows an example of two objects that will be created but in a different order. The second figure shows an example of two objects that will not be created as there is a circular reference between the ‘AUTO-n\' attributes that can never be resolved. (Only the relevant parts of the objects are shown in the figures.)\n\ninetnum:     193.0.7.35\nadmin-c:     auto-1\n\n\nperson:      admin guy\nnic-hdl:     auto-1\n\n\nIn the example of the figure above. the second, person object must be created first.

They both need to create a real value for an ‘auto-n\' tag. But they both reference the ‘auto-n\' tag of the other object, which does not yet exist.\n\nYou can avoid these complex arrangements of, and circular references to, auto-generated values in a single update message by sending multiple, consecutive updates instead.\n\nWhen processing each individual object, the software makes many checks including that:\n\n * The syntax of the object is correct.\n * The object passes all required authorisation checks.\n * All references to other objects can be resolved without conflicts.\n * The operation does not compromise referential integrity. For example, when an object is to be deleted, the server checks that it is not referenced from any other object in the RIPE Database.\n * The object complies with all software business rules, for example, not creating an allocation resource object without including the optional "org:" attribute. This is required in an allocation object.\n * The object complies with relevant policies, such as having the correct "status:" value in inetnum objects.\n\nIf all checks are passed, the update will be successful for this object. If one of these checks fails, the operation fails for this object. This is shown in the acknowledgement message and sometimes in notification messages. See the section on Notifications for more details.\n\nEach object in the update message is processed independently of others (except for the ‘AUTO-n\' references). If the operation fails on one object, the following objects will still be processed. There may, however, be consequences of a previous failed operation. For example if a person object creation fails, a later object creation which references this person object will fail the referential integrity checks because the person object does not exist in the database.\n\nAfter the software finishes processing all the objects in the update message, an acknowledgement message is returned to the sender of the original update. For email update messages, the acknowledgement will be another email sent to the address as specified in the "Reply-to:" field or "From:" field. For synchronous update messages it will be returned via the open HTTP connection. If the connection has timed out or been closed, no acknowledgement is sent. In all cases, the update will still be completed by the database software regardless of the status of HTTP sessions of validity of email addresses. Notification messages may also be sent.

Initially, when an object is presented by either email or Syncupdates, the database software has to decide if the object already exists or not. If it exists, the operation is modify. If it does not exist the operation is create. This issue can be forced with the use of the keyword ‘NEW'. If this keyword is included then the operation is set as create. If the object already exists, it will be an error. An existing object will never be updated when this keyword is included in the update. For email updates, this keyword will be in the ‘Subject' line. For client-based Syncupdates this keyword is passed as a parameter. It is not possible to use the keyword with the web-based Syncupdates form at: https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates\n\nThe RESTful update method works differently as it follows the standard REST paradigm. If the data is received by a POST method, the ‘NEW' keyword is set and it can only be a create operation. If the data is received by a PUT method it can only be a modify operation. If the method and operation do not match it is an error.\n\nWebupdates uses the RESTful API as the update method. So it must also follow the REST paradigm. There are additional checks at the Webupdates form level to ensure the right method is used.\n\nIf the operation is modify and the supplied object data is identical to the existing object stored in the database, allowing for white space variations, then the object is not modified. This is considered to be a successful ‘NO OPERATION'.\n\nThe delete operation is the same no matter what update method is used. The full version of the object must be supplied exactly as it is stored in the database. The supplied version is checked against the stored version by compressing the white spaces and doing a string comparison. If they don't match, the delete operation fails. If you query for the object before supplying the query result in a delete operation, make sure you use the correct query flags to avoid any filtering of the returned object. See section on Filtering Query Output for more details.\n\nTo delete an object, there must be no references to it from any other object in the database. A single reference will prevent it from being deleted. Note, however, that not all attributes containing primary keys of other objects are hard references. The routing policy attributes in an aut-num object can list other AS Numbers but these are not considered as references for the delete operation.\n\nFor the RESTful API and also Webupdates, the delete method is used. For mail and Syncupdates the pseudo attribute \"delete: some reason text\" must be added to the object data. As these update methods allow multiple objects in an update message, this pseudo-attribute must be part of the object itself to ensure a strong association with this pseudo-attribute and a specific object. Each object that is to be deleted must have a \"delete:\" pseudo attribute attached to it. It can be added at any point within the object or immediately before or after the object.\n\nObjects can still be deleted from the database even if they are not syntactically correct. This allows for old objects to be deleted long after the syntax has been changed. If the object was to be modified, any syntax errors would need to be corrected.\n\nFollowing Acceptable use policy, we strive to detect potential attacks. If a DoS attack is detected, we temporarily block the user's IP address.\n\nThe RIPE Database Terms and Conditions allow the RIPE NCC to block or suspend access to the RIPE Database services for any suspected abuse. Users exhibiting suspected abusive behavior may be permanently blocked from the system.

Some object types have additional business rules that only apply to those types when they are created.\n\n\n# Creating PERSON and ROLE Objects\n\nTo create person and role objects, you can either choose your own unique NIC handle or you can use ‘AUTO-n\' where the server will automatically assign a NIC handle.\n\nTo request the server to assign a NIC handle for you, specify the value of the "nic-hdl:" attribute as:\n\nnic-hdl: AUTO-<number>[<initials>]\n\nThe number is required. It does not form part of the NIC handle but acts as an index. If your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this NIC handle by the index. See the sub-section Object Processing for examples. The initials are optional. If you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the NIC handle. Otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "person:" or "role:" attribute. The syntax definition of a NIC handle allows for an optional suffix at the end of the character string. The default suffix is "-RIPE" when an ‘AUTO-n\' NIC handle is used. If you want to use another suffix, or have no suffix, or you want to select the number part, then you must specify the full NIC handle and not use the ‘AUTO-n\' option. Please note that if you specify a NIC handle that is currently in use, it may be considered as a modification operation, which may cause the operation to be refused depending on the update method used. See section 6.4 Update Operations for more details. If the operation continues, as a modification, it will usually result in an authentication error. If you select a NIC handle that has previously been used and deleted, an error will be returned.\n\nIf you are creating your first person or role object in the database, you must follow the procedure described in the sub-section \'New Organisation Startup\'.\n\n\n# Reusing NIC Handles\n\nThe person and role objects are identified by NIC handles. Historically, these were available to reuse as soon as an object was deleted. Many NIC handles have been used and reused by several different people. As that can lead to confusion, the NIC handles are no longer reusable. When a person or role object is created, the NIC handle is added to a list of used NIC handles. When the object is deleted the NIC handle remains on the list. It can never be reused. Please note that these objects cannot be deleted if they are referenced by any other object. This avoids accidental deletion of an object that is still in use. While some people try to create NIC handles with a ‘"meaningful\'" name, it should be remembered that they are only meant as a database index. If you delete one that is unreferenced, then realise you still need it, you will need to create a new one.\n\n\n# Creating ORGANISATION Objects\n\nTo create an organisation object, you must specify the ID of the object as ‘AUTO-n\'. It is not possible to select the ID yourself. It is always auto-generated.\n\norganisation: AUTO-<number>[<initials>].\n\nThe number is required. It does not form part of the ID but acts as an index. If your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this ID by the index. See the sub-section \'Object Processing\' for examples. The initials are optional. If you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the ID. Otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "org-name:" attribute.\n\nFor example, if you want ‘TTR\' as the initials in the organisation ID, you should put ‘AUTO-1TTR\' into the "organisation:" attribute, when you create the object. If you delete an organisation object you cannot recreate one with the same ID as the one you deleted or with any other ID that has been used previously.\n\n\n# New Organisation Startup (Creating First Objects)\n\nWhen you first use the RIPE Database, you need to create some basic objects. Every object you create in the database must be maintained. That means you need a mntner object. This object must reference a role (or person) object as a contact. However, the role (or person) object must be maintained. Therefore, a user cannot create either of these two objects first using any of the usual update methods.\n\nThere is separate page to create a role and maintainer pair, so that new users can get started.\n\nIf errors occur during the creation process, these are reported back to the user.

Once you have this first pair of objects, you can use the normal update methods for all other objects.',normalizedContent:'# special considerations for object creation\n\nmost object types follow the same rules when created. some object types have additional business rules that only apply to those types when they are created.\n\n\n# creating person and role objects\n\nto create person and role objects, you can either choose your own unique nic handle or you can use ‘auto-n\' where the server will automatically assign a nic handle.\n\nto request the server to assign a nic handle for you, specify the value of the "nic-hdl:" attribute as:\n\nnic-hdl: auto-<number>[<initials>]\n\nthe number is required. it does not form part of the nic handle but acts as an index. if your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this nic handle by the index. see the sub-section object processing for examples. the initials are optional. if you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the nic handle. otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "person:" or "role:" attribute. the syntax definition of a nic handle allows for an optional suffix at the end of the character string. the default suffix is "-ripe" when an ‘auto-n\' nic handle is used. if you want to use another suffix, or have no suffix, or you want to select the number part, then you must specify the full nic handle and not use the ‘auto-n\' option. please note that if you specify a nic handle that is currently in use, it may be considered as a modification operation, which may cause the operation to be refused depending on the update method used. see section 6.4 update operations for more details. if the operation continues, as a modification, it will usually result in an authentication error. if you select a nic handle that has previously been used and deleted, an error will be returned.\n\nif you are creating your first person or role object in the database, you must follow the procedure described in the sub-section \'new organisation startup\'.\n\n\n# reusing nic handles\n\nthe person and role objects are identified by nic handles. historically, these were available to reuse as soon as an object was deleted. many nic handles have been used and reused by several different people. as that can lead to confusion, the nic handles are no longer reusable. when a person or role object is created, the nic handle is added to a list of used nic handles. when the object is deleted the nic handle remains on the list. it can never be reused. please note that these objects cannot be deleted if they are referenced by any other object. this avoids accidental deletion of an object that is still in use. while some people try to create nic handles with a ‘"meaningful\'" name, it should be remembered that they are only meant as a database index. if you delete one that is unreferenced, then realise you still need it, you will need to create a new one.\n\n\n# creating organisation objects\n\nto create an organisation object, you must specify the id of the object as ‘auto-n\'. it is not possible to select the id yourself. it is always auto-generated.\n\norganisation: auto-<number>[<initials>].\n\nthe number is required. it does not form part of the id but acts as an index. if your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this id by the index. see the sub-section \'object processing\' for examples. the initials are optional. if you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the id. otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "org-name:" attribute.\n\nfor example, if you want ‘ttr\' as the initials in the organisation id, you should put ‘auto-1ttr\' into the "organisation:" attribute, when you create the object. if you delete an organisation object you cannot recreate one with the same id as the one you deleted or with any other id that has been used previously.\n\n\n# new organisation startup (creating first objects)\n\nwhen you first use the ripe database, you need to create some basic objects. every object you create in the database must be maintained. that means you need a mntner object. this object must reference a role (or person) object as a contact. however, the role (or person) object must be maintained. therefore, a user cannot create either of these two objects first using any of the usual update methods.\n\nthere is separate page to create a role and maintainer pair, so that new users can get started.\n\nif errors occur during the creation process, these are reported back to the user. if successful, the mntner object name and the nic handle are returned to the user. there is no partial success allowed. if one object can be successfully created during the intermediate stage, but the second object has errors, no object will be created.\n\nif you have nothing in the ripe database, this startup script is the only way to get started. once you have this first pair of objects, you can use the normal update methods for

The same rules apply to all the different set object types.\n\n\n# Creating Set Objects\n\nNewly created as-set names must be hierarchical. The hierarchy consists of a series of other as-set names separated by colons (:). Anything to the left of a colon is considered a parent, anything to the right is considered a child. At each stage, the whole of the hierarchy, including the colons, is considered as a single string that forms an object name. The set hierarchy can optionally start with an AS number reference as the top-level parent.\n\nExisting as-set names can be short (i.e. with a name only, e.g. AS-TEST) or hierarchical (i.e. with a name and AS number reference(s), e.g. AS3333:AS-TEST). It is now mandatory to only use hierarchical names to create an as-set object, so that the creation is authenticated by the AS number holder. This restriction does not apply to the other set types.\n\nAS-LIST1:AS-CUST\n\nAS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC\n\nare both valid AS-SET names\n\nIn each case, the whole string is the name of the as-set. So "AS-LIST1:AS-CUST" is a set name, including the colon :. But also "AS-LIST1" is a set name and this set is the parent of the set "AS-LIST1:AS-CUST".\n\nIn the second case, "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" is a set and it is the child of the set "AS3333:AS-RIPE". The \'parent\' of this set is AS3333, which is an aut-num object and not a set.\n\nFor each new (child) set object in a hierarchy, the immediate parent object must exist at the time of creating the new child set object. This is everything to the left of the last colon in the new child set object name, taken as a single (hierarchical) object name. Only one level of parent is checked. If any of the higher levels of parent objects have been deleted, it will not affect the creation of the new child object. The parent is only needed for authorisation.\n\nTherefore, if we were to create a new set "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS" then the immediate parent object, "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" must exist to authorise the new set creation. However, it does not matter if higher parent objects still exist, like "AS3333:AS-RIPE".\n\nIf an AS number is the first element in the hierarchical set name (the top-level parent) then the corresponding aut-num object must exist in order to create the next level in the hierarchy as this is the parent object. However, it is only needed for authorisation.\n\nTherefore, to create the set "AS3333:AS-RIPE", the aut-num object "AS3333" must exist to provide authorisation.\n\nIf an AS number appears anywhere else in the set name hierarchy it is treated as part of a set name and the aut-num object does not need to exist. You cannot have AS numbers as the first two levels in the name hierarchy. The second level could not be created, as there must be at least one element starting with "AS-" in the set name.\n\nSo "AS3333:AS-RipeOriginAS1" is a valid set name but AS1 is not an aut-num object, it is simply part of this set name.\n\n"AS3333:AS1" is not valid as it does not contain an "AS-" string defining an as-set name.\n\n"AS3333:AS1:AS-CUSTOMERS" is also not valid as it would require "AS3333:AS1" to exist as the parent to authorise the creation of this set.\n\nOnly hierarchical AS-SET objects can be created. If the set name is a single as-set (starting with AS- and with no colons) then it is considered to be non-hierarchical,\n\nThe as-set object can also list members of the set with a "members:" attribute. The as-set and aut-num objects referenced in a "members:" attribute do not need to exist.\n\n\n# Modifying and Deleting Set Objects\n\nAny intermediate set can be deleted from the hierarchy. This includes everything from the highest-level parent (which is a non-hierarchical as-set or aut-num object) to the lowest-level parent (which is everything to the left of the last colon in the name of the lowest level child object).\n\nIn the case of "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS", it is possible to delete any of these individual objects:\n\n"AS3333"\n\n"AS3333:AS-RIPE"\n\n"AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC"\n\nThey can also be recreated, as the check is only that the immediate parent object (to the left hand side of the last colon of the object name being created) exists. It does not check any higher-level parents or any existing child objects (right hand side of the colon). If several intermediate parents have been deleted, they can only be recreated in the correct sequence, starting with the highest level.\n\nIn the case of "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS", suppose we delete: "AS3333" and "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" but not "AS3333:AS-RIPE". We can recreate "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" as its parent object is "AS3333:AS-RIPE" and this object still exists. Authorisation is required from the existing parent object to recreate the child object.\n\nThere is an issue if the top-level parent is an as-set object and it is deleted. Suppose we have the set "AS-RIPE:AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-CUSTOMERS" and all the parents exist. (Note that this is subtly different to the set object above, as the top-level parent of this set is a set object, not an aut-num object.) We can delete the top-level parent set "AS-RIPE". The remaining sets "AS-RIPE:AS3333" to "AS-RIPE:AS3333:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS" are still valid. However, anyone can now recreate the deleted top-level parent set "AS-IX". This has no parent and therefore requires no hierarchical authorisation. This only becomes a problem if the next-level child set is deleted and the user tries to recreate it. Authorisation is now required from the new parent set that is owned by someone else.\n\nIf there are any aut-num objects with "member-of:" attributes referencing an as-set object then this as-set object cannot be deleted. If the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes are removed from the as-set object, it still cannot be deleted if there are any existing "member-of:" references to it.\n\nA "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute can be removed from an as-set object even if there are "member-of:" references to this as-set object. The "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is only needed for validation of an object\'s claim to membership of the set. A modification to an aut-num object with a "member-of:" reference to this as-set object will fail unless the "member-of:" reference is removed from the aut-num object.\n\nThe as-set object can be deleted if it has "members:" listed in the object that do exist. However, if there are "member-of:" references to the set in other objects, this set object cannot be deleted, even if you first remove the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\n\n# The ROUTE-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the route-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include route and route6 objects instead of aut-num object.\n * "member:" attributes include other route-set objects\n * The set name must have an element starting with \'RS-\'\n * The set name can also include AS numbers\n\n\n# The RTR-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the rtr-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include inet-rtr objects instead of aut-num objects.\n * "member:" attributes also include other rtr-set objects\n * The set name must have an element starting with \'RTRS-\'\n * The set name can also include AS numbers\n\n\n# The PEERING-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the peering-set object as to the as-set object\n * There are no "member:" attributes\n * "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes also include other peering-set objects\n * There are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes. Objects referenced in these attributes do not need to exist on creation and can be deleted later\n * The set name must have an element starting with \'PRNG-\'\n * The set name can also include AS numbers\n\n\n# The FILTER-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the filter-set object as to the as-set object\n * There are no "member:" attributes\n * "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes also include other filter-set objects\n * There are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes.

numbers',normalizedContent:'# set objects\n\nthroughout this section we have used the as-set object as an example. the same rules apply to all the different set object types.\n\n\n# creating set objects\n\nnewly created as-set names must be hierarchical. the hierarchy consists of a series of other as-set names separated by colons (:). anything to the left of a colon is considered a parent, anything to the right is considered a child. at each stage, the whole of the hierarchy, including the colons, is considered as a single string that forms an object name. the set hierarchy can optionally start with an as number reference as the top-level parent.\n\nexisting as-set names can be short (i.e. with a name only, e.g. as-test) or hierarchical (i.e. with a name and as number reference(s), e.g. as3333:as-test). it is now mandatory to only use hierarchical names to create an as-set object, so that the creation is authenticated by the as number holder. this restriction does not apply to the other set types.\n\nas-list1:as-cust\n\nas3333:as-ripe:as-apnic\n\nare both valid as-set names\n\nin each case, the whole string is the name of the as-set. so "as-list1:as-cust" is a set name, including the colon :. but also "as-list1" is a set name and this set is the parent of the set "as-list1:as-cust".\n\nin the second case, "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" is a set and it is the child of the set "as3333:as-ripe". the \'parent\' of this set is as3333, which is an aut-num object and not a set.\n\nfor each new (child) set object in a hierarchy, the immediate parent object must exist at the time of creating the new child set object. this is everything to the left of the last colon in the new child set object name, taken as a single (hierarchical) object name. only one level of parent is checked. if any of the higher levels of parent objects have been deleted, it will not affect the creation of the new child object. the parent is only needed for authorisation.\n\ntherefore, if we were to create a new set "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic:as-customers" then the immediate parent object, "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" must exist to authorise the new set creation. however, it does not matter if higher parent objects still exist, like "as3333:as-ripe".\n\nif an as number is the first element in the hierarchical set name (the top-level parent) then the corresponding aut-num object must exist in order to create the next level in the hierarchy as this is the parent object. however, it is only needed for authorisation.\n\ntherefore, to create the set "as3333:as-ripe", the aut-num object "as3333" must exist to provide authorisation.\n\nif an as number appears anywhere else in the set name hierarchy it is treated as part of a set name and the aut-num object does not need to exist. you cannot have as numbers as the first two levels in the name hierarchy. the second level could not be created, as there must be at least one element starting with "as-" in the set name.\n\nso "as3333:as-ripeoriginas1" is a valid set name but as1 is not an aut-num object, it is simply part of this set name.\n\n"as3333:as1" is not valid as it does not contain an "as-" string defining an as-set name.\n\n"as3333:as1:as-customers" is also not valid as it would require "as3333:as1" to exist as the parent to authorise the creation of this set.\n\nonly hierarchical as-set objects can be created. if the set name is a single as-set (starting with as- and with no colons) then it is considered to be non-hierarchical,\n\nthe as-set object can also list members of the set with a "members:" attribute. the as-set and aut-num objects referenced in a "members:" attribute do not need to exist.\n\n\n# modifying and deleting set objects\n\nany intermediate set can be deleted from the hierarchy. this includes everything from the highest-level parent (which is a non-hierarchical as-set or aut-num object) to the lowest-level parent (which is everything to the left of the last colon in the name of the lowest level child object).\n\nin the case of "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic:as-customers", it is possible to delete any of these individual objects:\n\n"as3333"\n\n"as3333:as-ripe"\n\n"as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic"\n\nthey can also be recreated, as the check is only that the immediate parent object (to the left hand side of the last colon of the object name being created) exists. it does not check any higher-level parents or any existing child objects (right hand side of the colon). if several intermediate parents have been deleted, they can only be recreated in the correct sequence, starting with the highest level.\n\nin the case of "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic:as-customers", suppose we delete: "as3333" and "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" but not "as3333:as-ripe". we can recreate "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" as its parent object is "as3333:as-ripe" and this object still exists. authorisation is required from the existing parent object to recreate the child object.\n\nthere is an issue if the top-level parent is an as-set object and it is deleted. suppose we have the set "as-ripe:as3333:as-ripe:as-customers" and all the parents exist. (note that this is subtly different to the set object above, as the top-level parent of this set is a set object, not an aut-num object.) we can delete the top-level parent set "as-ripe". the remaining sets "as-ripe:as3333" to "as-ripe:as3333:as-apnic:as-customers" are still valid. however, anyone can now recreate the deleted top-level parent set "as-ix". this has no parent and therefore requires no hierarchical authorisation. this only becomes a problem if the next-level child set is deleted and the user tries to recreate it. authorisation is now required from the new parent set that is owned by someone else.\n\nif there are any aut-num objects with "member-of:" attributes referencing an as-set object then this as-set object cannot be deleted. if the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes are removed from the as-set object, it still cannot be deleted if there are any existing "member-of:" references to it.\n\na "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute can be removed from an as-set object even if there are "member-of:" references to this as-set object. the "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is only needed for validation of an object\'s claim to membership of the set. a modification to an aut-num object with a "member-of:" reference to this as-set object will fail unless the "member-of:" reference is removed from the aut-num object.\n\nthe as-set object can be deleted if it has "members:" listed in the object that do exist. however, if there are "member-of:" references to the set in other objects, this set object cannot be deleted, even if you first remove the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\n\n# the route-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the route-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include route and route6 objects instead of aut-num object.\n * "member:" attributes include other route-set objects\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'rs-\'\n * the set name can also include as numbers\n\n\n# the rtr-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the rtr-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include inet-rtr objects instead of aut-num objects.\n * "member:" attributes also include other rtr-set objects\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'rtrs-\'\n * the set name can also include as numbers\n\n\n# the peering-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the peering-set object as to the as-set object\n * there are no "member:" attributes\n * "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes also include other peering-set objects\n * there are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes. objects referenced in these attributes do not need to exist on creation and can be deleted later\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'prng-\'\n * the set name can also include as numbers\n\n\n# the filter-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the filter-set object as to the as-set object\n * there are no "member:" attributes\n * "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes also include other filter-set objects\n * there are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes. objects referenced in these attributes do not need to exist on creation and can be deleted later\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'fltr-\'\n * the set name can also include as numbers',charsets:{},lastUpdated:"2024-01-05T14:12:09Z",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1704463929e3},{title:"Acknowledgment Message",frontmatter:{permalink:"/Notifications/Acknowledgment-Message"},regularPath:"/09.Notifications/01-Acknowledgment-Message.html",relativePath:"09.Notifications/01-Acknowledgment-Message.md",key:"v-413b77bd",path:"/Notifications/Acknowledgment-Message/",headers:[{level:2,title:"Email Acknowledgement Message",slug:"email-acknowledgement-message",normalizedTitle:"email acknowledgement message",charIndex:1211},{level:2,title:"Syncupdates Acknowledgement Message",slug:"syncupdates-acknowledgement-message",normalizedTitle:"syncupdates acknowledgement message",charIndex:5107},{level:2,title:"Webupdates Acknowledgement Message",slug:"webupdates-acknowledgement-message",normalizedTitle:"webupdates acknowledgement message",charIndex:6386}],headersStr:"Email Acknowledgement Message Syncupdates Acknowledgement Message Webupdates Acknowledgement Message",content:'# Acknowledgment Message\n\nThe acknowledgement (ack) message is always returned to the user who submitted the update to the database, however, the ack message is a unique notification because it is returned via the same method that was used to submit the update.

The same ack message was later used for both Syncupdates and Webupdates. Now Webupdates has a more customised web style of ack message, but Syncupdates still uses the original email ack message style. The RESTful API response is totally different and returns either XML or JSON.\n\nRegardless of the update method, one ack message is returned for each update. The results of all operations on all objects contained in the update are included in the single ack message. For all updates, an ack message that is in the original email style is always generated by the database software. This is logged in the RIPE NCC\'s internal log of database changes, along with copies of all notif messages.\n\n\n# Email Acknowledgement Message\n\nThis ack message holds the overall result of the update, which either ‘FAILED\' or was a total ‘SUCCESS\'. If the update included several objects and the operation on any of those objects failed, then the overall result is ‘FAILED\'. If no individual operation failed, then the overall result is ‘SUCCESS\'. This includes any individual ‘NOOP\' results where no operation was carried out, as the submitted object was identical to the object already in the database. This overall result is stated at the start of the subject line of the ack email sent to the user. Any user comment on the Subject line of the submitted update follows this result.\n\nSubject: SUCCESS: some user comment\nDate:    Thu, 11 Sep 2014 10:42:15 +0200 (CEST)\nFrom:    RIPE Database Administration local <unread@ripe.net>\nTo:      denis@ripe.net\n\n\nThe acknowledgement message content is split into sections. The first section shows from where the update was sent. This could be a copy of the update email header or the IP address for a synchronous connection. This section also includes a summary of the update results, explaining how many objects were recognised by the database software, how many operations were successful and how many failed.\n\nAn example first section of an acknowledgment message would look like this:\n\n>  From:       Denis Walker <denis@ripe.net>\n>  Subject:    some user comment\n>  Date:       Thu, 11 Sep 2014 10:42:14 +0200\n>  Reply-To:   Denis Walker <denis@ripe.net>\n>  Message-ID: <54116066.7030403@ripe.net>\n\nSUMMARY OF UPDATE:\n\nNumber of objects found:                   5\nNumber of objects processed successfully:  4\nCreate:         1\nModify:         2\nDelete:         0\nNo Operation:   1\nNumber of objects processed with errors:   1\nCreate:         0\nModify:         1\nDelete:         0\n\n\nThe next section is the "DETAILED EXPLANATION" of the acknowledgement message. This is split into three parts.\n\n * The first part lists all the objects where the operation failed. This will include "***Error:" messages as well as possible "***Info:" and "***Warning:" messages.\n * The next part shows all the operations that were successful. This may include additional "***Info:" and "***Warning:" messages with each operation listed.\n * The third part lists all the paragraphs from the update message that were not recognised as objects.\n\nEach part is separated in the ACK by a line containing several \'~\' characters. Within each part, the objects and paragraphs are listed in the order that they were processed. This is generally the order that they appear in the update message unless ‘AUTO-n\' NIC Handles are referenced. The line before each object contains three hyphen characters (-) . This allows for easy parsing by script.\n\nBelow is an example of this section of the acknowledgement message:\n\nDETAILED EXPLANATION: \n\n***Warning: Invalid keyword(s) found: some user comment\n***Warning: All keywords were ignored\n\n    \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe following object(s) were found to have ERRORS:      \n\n\n---\nUpdate FAILED: [person] dn1172-ripe          de nis\n***Error: Syntax error in object\n\nperson:          de nis\naddress:         here\nphone:           1\n***Error: Syntax error in "1"\nnic-hdl:          dn1172-ripe\nmnt-by:         TEST-MNT\nsource:          ripe\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe following object(s) were processed SUCCESSFULLY:\n\n\n---\nModify SUCCEEDED: [person] dn1172-ripe          de nis\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe following paragraph(s) do not look like objects\nand were NOT PROCESSED:\n\nThis is a private email.\nIt is intended only for the named recipient.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nThere are many reasons why the operation may fail for an object, including syntax error, authorisation failure and failed business rules check.\n\n~\n\n\n\n# Syncupdates Acknowledgement Message\n\nThere are only two differences between an ack message returned from a Syncupdate update and an ack message returned from an email update. The ‘SUCCESS\' or ‘FAILED\' result shown in the email\'s subject line is now shown as a code in the first line of a Syncupdates response. However, this response code does not provide the same information. An update that fails with an authorisation error will return response code 403. Any other object update failure,or success, will return response code 200. This indicates that the update was successfully processed. It does not mean that all the objects in the update message were successful operations. This must be determined from the numbers of successes and failures in the SUMMARY part of the message output.\n\nIf you use Syncupdates via the web form (see the section \'Syncupdates\') there is no response code. All information has to be interpreted using the content of the ack message.\n\nThe second difference is also in the first section of the ack message. Whereas the email ack message gives details of the received email, the Syncupdates ack message gives details of the IP address sending in the update.\n\n- From-Host: 2001:67c:2e8:13:198e:207d:6a7:47c5\n- Date/Time: Fri Sep 12 11:39:37 2014\n\n\n\n# Webupdates Acknowledgement Message\n\nThe Webupdates ack message is very different to both the email and Syncupdates ack message. Only a single object is allowed in a Webupdates update message. If the update is successful one of the following messages is added to the top of the output:\n\n * Object successfully created\n * Object successfully updated!\n * PERSON object DI1432-RIPE successfully deleted\n\nIf the update fails, the errors are shown in different ways depending on the web format that you are using. If you are using the field format, a general error message may be displayed at the top of the form:\n\n\n\nA specific error will be added, immediately after the attribute that contains the actual error:\n\n\n\nIf it is a general error that does not relate to a specific attribute, but rather to the whole update, this error message will be shown at the top of the output:\n\n\n\nIf you are using the single text area, error messages cannot be added after the attribute that contains the error. Therefore, in this case, all error messages will appear at the top of the output:\n\n\n\n\n# RESTful API Acknowledgement Message\n\nThe ack message for an API update is returned as either an XML or JSON response. The response includes the object that was submitted in the update. If there was an error, an error message section is included at the end of the response. For example an XML error response would include this section:\n\n<errormessages>\n    <errormessage severity="Error" text="Syntax error in %s">\n        <attribute name="phone" value="31 20 535 4444"/>\n        <args value="31 20 535 4444"/>\n    </errormessage>\n</errormessages>\n\n\nFor a creation, using the API, that returns an error message, the output is the same as for an API update. If creation is successful, the version of the object that has been added to the database is returned. This may be different to the version that was submitted in the update if it has any generated attributes.',normalizedContent:'# acknowledgment message\n\nthe acknowledgement (ack) message is always returned to the user who submitted the update to the database, however, the ack message is a unique notification because it is returned via the same method that was used to submit the update. so, for an email update, the ack message is returned to the email address that sent the update. for any other update method, the ack message is returned as an http response.\n\nthe original style of the ack message was designed for an email update response. the same ack message was later used for both syncupdates and webupdates. now webupdates has a more customised web style of ack message, but syncupdates still uses the original email ack message style. the restful api response is totally different and returns either xml or json.\n\nregardless of the update method, one ack message is returned for each update. the results of all operations on all objects contained in the update are included in the single ack message. for all updates, an ack message that is in the original email

email header or the ip address for a synchronous connection. this section also includes a summary of the update results, explaining how many objects were recognised by the database software, how many

"irt-nfy:"\n * "ref-nfy:"\n\nWhere there are multiple instances of any notification attribute, all email values will be sent an individual notif message email. Where the notification attribute is contained in a referenced object (for example, in a mntner) and there are multiple references, all the referenced objects will be taken to form a list of email addresses. All these addresses will be sent an individual notif message email. Updates can contain multiple objects. These objects can contain different sets of notification email addresses. Some of the notification email addresses may appear in more than one set. Each email address to be sent a notif message has its own individual message generated that only contains details of the objects that reference that email address. So each notif message that is sent may contain different information.\n\nThere are many attributes related to notifications. These may be contained in many related objects. All the notification attributes can take multiple values and all appropriate email addresses will be used. It is not always obvious why you have received a notification. You can find out why you received a notification by following all references from the object(s) listed in the notification message and looking at the notification attributes that all of these objects contain.\n\n\n# Notification Attributes\n\nThe "notify:" attribute is an optional attribute in all object types. It is used when an object is successfully created or updated. The "notify:" attribute of the old version of the object is used if the object is being modified. If the update fails for any reason then no notifications will be sent to any "notify:" email addresses.\n\nThe optional "mnt-nfy:" and mandatory "upd-to:" attributes can only be included in mntner objects.\n\nWhen a maintained object is updated successfully, a notification message will be sent to email addresses contained in all "mnt-nfy:" attributes of all mntner objects that are referenced by the updated object.\n\nSometimes an update fails one or more of the required authentications. This is considered a security issue. It could mean that someone is attempting to gain control of or change your data. In this case, notifications are sent to all the email addresses contained in all the "upd-to:" attributes of all the mntner objects that are referenced by the object in the update. This is sometimes the only attribute holding an email address that is associated with an object. The RIPE NCC may occasionally use this email address to contact someone related to an object in the RIPE Database for any security-related issue. More general issues may also be raised addressed using this email address if this is the only contact point for an object.\n\nThe optional "irt-nfy:" attribute is only allowed in an irt object. This is used when a reference to an irt object is added to, or removed from, an inetnum or inet6num object (by means of the "mnt-irt:" attribute).\n\nThe optional "ref-nfy:" attribute is only allowed in an organisation object. This is used when a reference to an organisation object is added to an object (using the "org:" attribute).\n\n\n# Format of the Notification Message\n\nThe format of a notification message is similar to the ack message for an email update. The first section of the message explains why you are being sent this notification. The next section of the notification message has the email header or IP address details showing where the update came from. The final section shows the changes that were contained in the update message, if it was successful. For a creation it shows the newly created object. For a deletion, it shows the object that was deleted. For a modification, it shows the new version of the object. In this case, a ‘diff\' is also included to show the difference between the original object and the new object. If the modification update failed, the current version of the object is shown and the diff shows the change that was being attempted.\n\nIf using passwords in an update message, be cautious when entering this. If you mistype the password pseudo-attribute (eg "password: clear_password") the notification will include your clear text password.\n\nThe "upd-to:" attribute in a MNTNER object should only include the email address of a person or team in your organisation who deals with security issues. If this team receives a notification containing a clear text password, they should advise the user to change their password.\n\nEach notification message is only sent to a single email address. There is no email address copied (via CC) in any notification. When multiple email addresses need to be notified of the same update, each address will receive its own email. This email will contain all notification details of objects that are contained in the update message that relates to that email address. For an update with multiple objects, referencing several mntner objects, where several objects have a variety of notification attributes, the software builds a matrix of email addresses and updated objects. This ensures that only the appropriate details are sent to each email address.',normalizedContent:'# notification messages\n\nthere are a number of attributes that may cause notification (notif)

A reference to a mntner object within any object defines authorisation necessary to perform operations on that object or on a set of related objects. Such reference is provided by means of several attributes including "mnt-by:", "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:", "mnt-domains:", "mnt-ref:" and "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nThe mntner object contains one or more mandatory "auth:" attributes. Each attribute begins with a keyword identifying the authorisation method followed by the authorisation information or token needed to enforce that method. The irt object also has mandatory "auth:" attributes used for authorisation.\n\nAll updates require authorisation. A credential that is valid for one of the authorisation tokens of one of the relevant mntner objects, must be supplied.

Because it uses an eight-character salt, a\n                       passphrase of almost unlimited length and the encrypted hash\n                       is hidden from public view, this scheme is quite stable\n                       against dictionary attacks.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: MD5-PW $1$abcd4321$HyM/GVhPqXkkIMVerxxQ3z\nPGPKEY                 This is a strong form of authorisation. The authorisation\n                       information is a signature identity pointing to a public key\n                       certificate, which is stored in a separate key-cert object.\n                       The update is authorised if the transaction is signed by the\n                       corresponding private key. The RIPE NCC does not guarantee\n                       that a key belongs to any specific entity. Anyone can supply\n                       any public keys, with any ownership information, to the RIPE\n                       Database. These keys can be used to protect other objects by\n                       checking that the update comes from a user who knows the\n                       corresponding secret key. The database software only allows\n                       current keys (that have not expired) to sign an update\n                       message, and signed messages are only valid for one hour.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: PGPKEY-1380K9U1\nSSO                    This scheme is based on the RIPE NCC Access single sign-on\n                       (SSO) system. It takes the management of these authorisation\n                       tokens outside of the RIPE Database. The authorisation\n                       tokens are managed by the RIPE NCC Access software. To use\n                       this, you must first create an account with RIPE NCC Access.\n                       \n                       The SSO system was introduced so that when somebody signs in\n                       once with RIPE NCC Access, that account authorises them to\n                       use certain services that support it, such as Webupdates or\n                       the Syncupdates web form.\n                       \n                       The credential in the mntner object uses the keyword SSO\n                       followed by the email address used to sign in to your SSO\n                       account. You can add many different SSO credentials to a\n                       mntner object and add your SSO credential to as many mntner\n                       objects as you wish (provided you have authority to update\n                       each mntner object using existing authorisation). If you\n                       change your email address in your RIPE NCC Access\n                       preferences, this will immediately be reflected in any\n                       mntner objects where this access account is referenced.\n                       \n                       authorisation using SSO can be done from Webupdates and the\n                       Syncupdates web form. You can sign into your RIPE NCC Access\n                       account directly from Webupdates and Syncupdates. Using any\n                       of the update features from Webupdates/Syncupdates you can\n                       create, modify and delete objects. No password is needed -\n                       you are already authenticated and authorised to make these\n                       updates, assuming the object(s) are maintained by one of\n                       your SSO mntner objects.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: SSO dbtest _at_ ripe _dot_ net\nX.509                  This is similar to PGP. You ned a certificate and a private\n                       key. The certificate must be included in a key-cert object.\n                       The update is authorised if the transaction is signed by the\n                       corresponding X.509 private key. The RIPE NCC does not\n                       guarantee that a certificate belongs to any specific entity.\n                       Anyone can supply any certificate, with any ownership\n                       information, to the RIPE Database. Those certificates can be\n                       used to protect other objects by checking that the update\n                       comes froma user who knows the corresponding private key.\n                       The database software only allows current keys (that have\n                       not expired) to sign an update message, and signed messages\n                       are only valid for one hour.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: X509-3333\n\n\n# Solving Authentication Problems\n\nGiven the flexibility of the RIPE Database and the maintainer system, there can be cases where you find yourself unable to authenticate. Currently, only certain combinations of authentication and update methods are compatible, as shown in this table:\n\n                             SSO   PGP   MD5\nWebupdates (Web interface)   Yes   No    Yes*\nEmail                        No    Yes   Yes*\nAPI                          No    No    Yes\nSyncupdates                  No    Yes   Yes*\n\n*It works, but is not recommended\n\nWe recommend that if you predominantly use the web interface, you only use the SSO, and if you mainly use syncupdates or email updates, you use PGP.\n\nDepending on your use case, it is important to carefully consider which authentication method you put on each maintainer you manage. For example, there are three basic situations where authentication might fail when trying to use the web interface:\n\n * The object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer that is not yours. You therefore rightfully do not have access.\n * The object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer with several SSO account, none of which are yours. The maintainer also doesn\'t have a shared MD5 password that would allow you to authenticate.\n * The object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer that only has a PGP key as the authorisation.\n\nFor cases 1 and 2, you need to ask the administrative or technical contact of the maintainer to give you the appropriate access. For case 2, you can use another update method that does support your authentication, such as email.\n\nLastly, in case your maintainer is protected with a MD5 password that you forgot, you can reset it here.',normalizedContent:'# authorisation model\n\nthe mntner objects serve as anonymous containers that hold authorisation credentials. a reference to a mntner object within any object defines authorisation necessary to perform operations on that object or on a set of related objects. such reference is provided by means of several attributes including "mnt-by:", "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:", "mnt-domains:", "mnt-ref:" and "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nthe mntner object contains one or more mandatory "auth:" attributes. each attribute begins with a keyword identifying the authorisation method followed by the authorisation information or token needed to enforce that method. the irt object also has mandatory "auth:" attributes used for authorisation.\n\nall updates require authorisation. a credential that is valid for one of the authorisation tokens of one of the relevant mntner objects, must be supplied. different methods of authorisation require different authorisation tokens, as shown in the table below of authorisation methods that are currently supported.\n\nvisit this section to know more about mntner object.\n\nauthorisation method

Methods\n\n * MD5 Password\n * PGP Key\n * X.509 Certificate\n * Single Sign-On\n\n\n# MD5 Password\n\nAn MD5 password can be used by any of the update methods currently in use. See section 5.2 Update Methods for more details of these methods.\n\nFor email updates, password authorisation information is supplied using a "password:" pseudo-attribute. The value of this attribute is a clear-text passphrase, corresponding to the encrypted hash. It can appear anywhere in the body of the message, but not within mail headers. Line continuation is not allowed for this attribute. The attribute and the passphrase should fit on one line. If you split the passphrase across multiple lines, this will be treated as a syntax error. If you have a very long passphrase, please note that some email clients split lines at a pre-defined character position. If multiple passwords are required, a "password:" pseudo-attribute must be included in the update for each password. The Webupdates web form includes a ‘Session Passwords\' field. Many passwords can be added, one at a time, using this field, up to a pre-defined limit. For any update in this session, all session passwords will be added to the update that is performed via the web form.\n\nIn the single text area form of Webupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added as part of the update body, in the text area, in the same way as with an email update. The session passwords also apply in this case.\n\nUsing the Syncupdates web form there is no ‘Session Passwords\' field but again the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added. When using the HTTP POST and GET requests for Syncupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute must be supplied as part of the message body.\n\nWith the RESTful API, any required passwords must be included in the URI query parameters. For more details see the API documentation.\n\n\n# PGP Key\n\nTo use PGP authentication you must first create a private/public key pair. There are many third-party applications that will allow you to do this. You must keep the private key secure. The public key is entered into the RIPE Database in a key-cert object. (See \'Description of the key-cert Object\' for details.)\n\nSome email clients allow you to import your private key into the client. This can then be used to sign any email update you submit. Alternatively, you can use third-party software to sign an update with your private key and paste the signed update into the body of an email.\n\nA signed update message can also be pasted into the Syncupdates web form. When using the HTTP POST and GET requests for Syncupdates, the signed update must be supplied in the message body.\n\nPGP-signed updates cannot be submitted using the RESTful API. As Webupdates uses the API in the background, you cannot paste a signed update into a Webupdates text area either.\n\nFor your PGP-signed update to pass authentication checks, you must have your public key in the database in a key-cert object.\n\nPGP authentication creation steps are in the appendix.\n\n\n# Use in the MAINTAINER object\n\nPGP authentication can be activated by setting the value of an "auth:" attribute to PGPKEY-<id> where <id> is the PGP key ID to be used for authentication. This string is the same one which is used in the corresponding key-cert object\'s "key-cert:" attribute.\n\nRemember that if you have multiple "auth:" attributes in a maintainer or if you have multiple "mnt-by:" attributes in an object, all possible authentication methods are combined by a logical OR which means that any single one of the specified authentication methods can be used. There is not security advantage in using PGP authentication with an object which can also be updated with password authentication.\n\nThere are currently no referential integrity checks carried out on the "auth:" attribute values. If you change your "auth:" to refer to a non existent key-cert object, or someone else\'s key-cert object you have locked your mntner. You will then have to contact us for assistance to un-lock it. Also, if you delete your key-cert object you will again lock your mntner until you re-create the key-cert object.\n\nThis is an example of a valid mntner object which uses PGP authentication:\n\nmntner:         EXAMPLE-MNT\ndescr:          Example maintainer\nadmin-c:        JOE1-RIPE\nupd-to:         joe@example.net\nauth:           PGPKEY-4B8AE00D\nmnt-by:         EXAMPLE-MNT\ncreated:        2022-10-26T11:38:51Z\nlast-modified:  2022-10-26T11:38:51Z\nsource:         RIPE\n\n\n\n# Using authentication when sending updates\n\nPGP signed updates can be sent to the database simply by signing the body of the message containing the updates and sending it to the server. Remember to use ASCII armoring.\n\nMultiple GP-signed and non-signed parts can be supplied in a single update message, each part is processed separately. You can supply several objects which are protected by different PGP keys in a single update message, providing all required signatures are present.\n\nPGP parts with invalid signatures are handled as plain text. If the object is protected by an authentication method other than PGP, or has multiple authentication schemes in use and the required authentication is present, it will still be authorised. If PGP is the only form of authentication present the authentication will fail.\n\nPGP authentication can be mixed with any of the other forms of authentication in the same mntner object. Each authentication method used can have multiple instances present. All the authentications present in a mntner object are processed with a logical \'OR\' to determine if the authentication is passed.\n\nPGP can be used with updates submitted by e-mail or using the syncupdates facility. It cannot be used with the webupdates interface.\n\n\n# X.509 Certificate\n\nThis is handled in a similar way to PGP. You need a certificate and private key. There is third-party software available to generate these as well as command-line tools, for example OpenSSL. The certificate must be included in a key-cert object in the database. The generated certificate and private key are in binary files. The OpenSSL tool will convert the certificate into plain text to be included in the key-cert object. For X.509 key-cert objects, you must specify the "key-cert:" value as ‘AUTO-1\'. The database software will then set this value. These values cannot be reused. Once deleted, an X.509 key-cert object cannot be recreated.\n\nIf your email client supports S/MIME you can import the certificate and private key into the client. Email updates can now be signed with your X.509 private key. Alternatively, you can sign your update using your private key with OpenSSL and paste it into the email message body.\n\nA signed update message can also be pasted into the Syncupdates web form. When using the HTTP POST and GET requests for Syncupdates, the signed update must be supplied in the message body.\n\nX.509 signed updates cannot be submitted via the RESTful API. Additionally, since Webupdates utilizes the API in the background, you are unable to paste a signed update into a Webupdates text area. However, you can submit updates through the RESTful API using Client Certificate Authentication.\n\nFor your X.509 signed update to pass authorisation checks, you must have your certificate in the database in a key-cert object.\n\n\n# Single Sign-On\n\nThe SSO (single sign-on) authorisation is different to all the other methods. This one provides some authentication as well. SSO is based on RIPE NCC Access. To use SSO as an authorisation method in the RIPE Database, you must first create a RIPE NCC Access account. This provides some details about who you are. It is no longer a totally anonymous password in a box (where the box is the mntner object).\n\nThe RIPE NCC Access account username, which is your email address, becomes the authorisation credential used by the database software. If you change your RIPE NCC Access username to a different email address, this is immediately reflected in the mntner object.\n\nCurrently SSO authorisation only works with web-based update methods. This includes Webupdates and the Syncupdates web form. You need to sign in to your RIPE NCC Access account in order to authorise an update.',normalizedContent:'# using the authorisation methods\n\n * md5 password\n * pgp key\n * x.509 certificate\n * single sign-on\n\n\n# md5 password\n\nan md5 password can be used by any of the update methods currently in use. see section 5.2 update methods for more details of these methods.\n\nfor email updates, password authorisation information is supplied using a "password:" pseudo-attribute. the value of this attribute is a clear-text passphrase, corresponding to the encrypted hash. it can appear anywhere in the body of the message, but not within mail headers. line continuation is not allowed for this attribute. the attribute and the passphrase should fit on one line. if you split the passphrase across multiple lines, this will be treated as a syntax error. if you have a very long passphrase, please note that some email clients split lines at a pre-defined character position. if multiple passwords are required, a "password:" pseudo-attribute must be included in the update for each password. the webupdates web form includes a ‘session passwords\' field. many passwords can be added, one at a time, using this field, up to a pre-defined limit. for any update in this session, all session passwords will be added to the update that is performed via the web form.\n\nin the single text area form of webupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added as part of the update body, in the text area, in the same way as with an email update. the session passwords also apply in this case.\n\nusing the syncupdates web form there is no ‘session passwords\' field but again the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added. when using the http post and get requests for syncupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute must be supplied as part of the message body.\n\nwith the restful api, any required passwords must be included in the uri query parameters. for more details see the api documentation.\n\n\n# pgp key\n\nto use pgp authentication you must first create a private/public key pair. there are many third-party applications that will allow you to do this. you must keep the private key secure. the public key is entered into the ripe database in a key-cert object. (see \'description of the key-cert object\' for details.)\n\nsome email clients allow you to import your private key into the client. this can then be used to sign any email update you submit. alternatively, you can use third-party software to sign an update with your private key and paste the signed update into the body of an email.\n\na signed update message can also be pasted into the syncupdates web form. when using the http post and get requests for syncupdates, the signed update must be supplied in the message body.\n\npgp-signed updates cannot be submitted using the restful api. as webupdates uses the api in the background, you cannot paste a signed update into a webupdates text area either.\n\nfor your pgp-signed update to pass authentication checks, you must have your public key in the database in a key-cert object.\n\npgp authentication creation steps are in the appendix.\n\n\n# use in the maintainer object\n\npgp authentication can be activated by setting the value of an "auth:" attribute to pgpkey-<id> where <id> is the pgp key id to be used for authentication. this string is the same one which is used in the corresponding key-cert object\'s "key-cert:" attribute.\n\nremember that if you have multiple "auth:" attributes in a maintainer or if you have multiple "mnt-by:" attributes in an object, all possible authentication methods are combined by a logical or which means that any single one of the specified authentication methods can be used. there is not security advantage in using pgp authentication with an object which can also be updated with password authentication.\n\nthere are currently no referential integrity checks carried out on the "auth:" attribute values. if you change your "auth:" to refer to a non existent key-cert object, or someone else\'s key-cert object you have locked your mntner. you will then have to contact us for assistance to un-lock it. also, if you delete your key-cert object you will again lock your mntner

Security of Data Using Authorisation\n\nIndividual data objects must be protected with a mntner object. The mntner is referenced by the "mnt-by:" attribute in the object. This attribute is defined as multiple in all object types, so several mntner objects can be used to protect one object.\n\nOnly those mntner objects referenced by the "mnt-by:" attributes are authorised to modify or delete the object. Authorisation checks work in line with the logical “OR” - for the operation to be authorised, you must supply information required by at least one credential from one of the referenced mntner objects. As you can supply information required by any credential for the operation to be authorised, this means that an object\'s protection level is determined by the weakest authorisation method used in the mntner objects referenced by that object.\n\nWhen the "mnt-by:" attribute is added to an object for the first time (as part of object creation or modification), the operation should pass authorisation checks for at least one of the mntner objects referenced by one of the "mnt-by:" attributes.\n\nIf the operation is a modification and the old object already has one or more "mnt-by:" attributes, then one of the mntner objects referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes in the old object must authorise the change. If the old object does not have any "mnt-by:" attributes, then one of the mntner objects referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes in the new object must authorise the change. All new objects must have at least one "mnt-by:". There are still some historic person and role objects that do not have any "mnt-by:" attributes.\n\nAuthorisation is also used in a hierarchical way. Much of the operational data in the RIPE Database is structured hierarchically. For example, the address space is allocated in large blocks, which can then be divided in a number of ways and then finally assigned to End Users. Authorisation in a hierarchy works from the top down to the bottom. So each child object needs to be authorised by the holder of the parent object.

As with all objects, it must satisfy its own mntner object references in the "mnt-by:" attributes. It must also satisfy two separate hierarchical authorisations. All three authorisations must be passed for the object to be created. For modify and delete of a route(6) object, only its own mntner object in the "mnt-by:" attributes needs to authorise the operation.\n\nAddress space: the creation of a route(6) object needs to be authorised either by existing, related route(6) objects or related address space objects. The route(6) objects are checked first. If a route(6) object with an exact matching address prefix exists, it will be used for authorisation. If this does not exist, one with a less specific prefix is used. If no such route(6) object exists, an address space object (inetnum or inet6num) with an exact matching prefix will be used, otherwise a less specific prefix is used. One of these objects will always be found in the database. Following this order, the first valid object found is the one used to authorise the new object creation. If the supplied credentials do not satisfy the authorisation required by this first valid object found, then authorisation fails. The software does not look for the next possible valid object in the sequence.\n\nAutonomous System (AS) Number: you do not need to authenticate against the origin AS Number when creating a route(6) object. Any originating AS Number can be used, so long as it’s not in reserved space. The originating AS Number does not need to exist in the RIPE Database.\n\nThe origin AS holder is notified of a route(6) creation, using the "notify:" attribute on the aut-num object, if the both the AS Number exists and the "notify:" attribute is set.\n\nThe RIPE Database is used as an inter-routing registry. However, it is only possible to create a route(6) object in the RIPE Database with an origin prefix that has been allocated to the RIPE region.\n\n\n# Authorisation rules for creating route objects\n\nThe IRR that the RIPE NCC operated is tightly coupled with the RIPE Database, which contains resource and contact information for the address space and ASNs that the RIPE NCC manages. This means that when you query for a certain resource in the RIPE Database, you will also get relevant results from the IRR. Conversely, when entering data into IRR, authorisation for the relevant RIPE Database objects is required.\n\nTo create a route(6) (i.e. a route or route(6)) object in the RIPE database, you must authenticate against the address space you are referring to. Only address space within the RIPE region can be referred to.\n\nWhen creating a route(6) object you must authenticate against multiple maintainers to verify that you have control over the address space you are referring to. This means the related inet(6)num object must exist in the RIPE Database and you can authenticate against it, before you can create a route(6) object in the IRR.\n\nWhen you submit a new route(6) object, the following validation process is triggered:\n\n * The maintainer of any existing route(6) object that is exactly matching or covering a less specific prefix is checked. If there is none, the maintainer of the inet(6)num object that is exactly matching or covering a less specific prefix is checked.\n * If successful, the maintainer of the route(6) object you are creating is verified.\n\nThe order in which the RIPE Database will verify available maintainers is:\n\n * mnt-routes\n * mnt-lower\n * mnt-by\n\nThis means that if a route(6) or inet(6)num object has all three kinds of maintainers defined, you must use the "mnt-routes:" attributes to authenticate. In this case, you cannot use the "mnt-lower:" or "mnt-by:" attributes. Likewise, if you have a "mnt-lower:" and a "mnt-by:" attribute on the objects, the "mnt-lower:" attribute must be used.\n\nHere is a flowchart outlining the entire authorisation process.\n\nYou can only create a route(6) object for a prefix you manage. If these objects are maintained by your organisation\'s single shared maintainer, you just need to supply one credentials to satisfy all of the requirements. However, when you use multiple maintainers, you may need to supply different credentials to create a single route(6) objects.\n\nIf you wish to avoid having to supply multiple credentials, it is best to set up hierarchical authorisation by adding a "mnt-routes:" attribute to all of your resource objects and consistently use this maintainer to create and manage route(6) objects.\n\n\n# Creating route objects referring to resources you don\'t manage\n\nYou do not need to authenticate against the origin AS Number when creating a route(6) object. Any originating AS Number can be used, so long as it\'s not in reserved space. The originating AS Number does not have to exist in the RIPE Database.\n\nIf the originating AS Number exists in the RIPE Database, and if the aut-num object contains one or more notify: attributes, these will be used to notify the originating AS Number holder when the route(6) object is created.\n\n\n# Creating route objects for out-of-region (non-RIPE) resources\n\nIt is not possible to create a route(6) object in the RIPE Routing Registry that refers to a prefix that is not managed by the RIPE NCC, but by one of the other Regional Internet Registries.\n\nThis change was introduced by NWI-5, which is documented in a RIPE Labs article: Out-of-Region ROUTE(6) and AUT-NUM Objects in the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Force deleting blocking route objects\n\nWhen the RIPE Database gets authorisation from the address space for the creation your new route(6) object, it will first check if there is an exact matching or less specific route(6) object. If this route object has a maintainer that you do not have the credentials for, it can block you from creating a new route(6) object. In this case you, as the resource holder, can simply delete the blocking route(6) object.\n\nNormally an object can only be deleted if the operation is authorised by one of the maintainers in the "mnt-by:" attributes of the object to be deleted. However, the force delete functionality also looks for the exact matching, encompassing or less specific address space object that was co-maintained by the RIPE NCC in the hierarchy of the object that is to be deleted. Co-maintained objects include resources that were allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC, and also legacy resources under contract.\n\nThe result is that the "mnt-lower:" attribute of an allocation, or the "mnt-by:" attribute of a PI or anycast assignment, has the authority to reclaim any more specific or related object. Practically, this means a route object can be deleted by:\n\n * the mnt-by: attribute of the route object\n * the mnt-routes: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC\n * the mnt-lower: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC\n\nIt is important to understand that this functionality only works when the parent inet(6)num object is protected by the RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT or RIPE-NCC-LEGACY-MNT maintainer. If not, the system will look up in the hierarchy until it finds an inet(6)num which has a RIPE NCC maintainer on it, after which it will look at the "mnt-lower:" or "mnt-routes:" attributes on that

the "mnt-by:" attribute of a pi or anycast assignment, has the authority to reclaim any more specific or related object. practically, this means a route object can be deleted by:\n\n * the mnt-by: attribute of the route object\n * the mnt-routes: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc\n * the mnt-lower: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc\n\nit is important to understand that this functionality only works when the parent inet(6)num object is protected by the ripe-ncc-hm-mnt or ripe-ncc-legacy-mnt maintainer. if not, the system will look up in the hierarchy until it finds an inet(6)num which has a ripe ncc maintainer on it, after which it will look at the "mnt-lower:" or "mnt-routes:" attributes on that inet(6)num object and use them for the authentication.',charsets:{},lastUpdated:"2024-01-05T14:12:09Z",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1704463929e3},{title:"Protection of Reverse Delegation

More information\n\n\n# How to Create an IRT Object\n\n\n# Manual creation\n\n# Requirements\n\nIf you are an IRT and want to create an irt object in the RIPE Database, you need to following:\n\n * A maintainer for that object. This should be a mntner object in the RIPE Database\n * A key-cert object in the RIPE Database containing a public PGP key\n * An IP address (range) for which you are responsible as an IRT. This should be in the form of an inet(6)num object in the RIPE Database.\n * Any other information that is mandatory for an irt object\n\n# The Maintainer (MNTNER object)\n\nA maintainer of an object in the RIPE Database is an entity, which can alone make changes to that object. A mntner object represents the maintainer. The maintainer authenticates change request either by using a PGP-Key, password or SSO account as specified in "auth:" attribute.\n\nIf you as a team are responsible for a range of IP addresses, there almost certainly will be an inet(6)num object in the database. The maintainer of this object can also maintain your irt object.\n\nThe RIPE NCC will not create a mntner object just for maintenance of an irt object.\n\n# The PGP Key and the KEY-CERT Object\n\nA PGP key for secure email communication is mandatory for an IRT to create an irt object. Before creating one, you will have to create a key-cert object matching your PGP key in the RIPE Database.\n\nYou can create one by sending a completed template by email to auto-dbm@ripe.net\n\nHere is an example:\n\nkey-cert:     PGPKEY-6DFC4771\nmethod:       PGP\nowner:        DFN-CERT (2003), ENCRYPTION Key \nfingerpr:     E8 A7 18 F7 DF 3D 19 64  8D 26 C4 CC BF 2F 0C C4\ncertif:       -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\ncertif:       Version: PGP Key Server 0.9.5\ncertif:\ncertif:       mQENAz3SIaUAAAEIAKze7wWJ9BDa3iDcQpxZ9+YSVxq+j1prWPsnINMm8GyTMU2H\n\n[...]\n\ncertif:       epPs4s0AnjV6ncb6BrbHiU+zeVY8tcW1bopeAJ0VuW0D/+3joueFiL7fDGSV6KPu\ncertif:       Uw==\ncertif:       =DKvl\ncertif:       -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nmnt-by:       TRUSTED-INTRODUCER-MNT\nnotify:       tiirt@stelvio.nl\nnotify:       dfncert@cert.dfn.de\nsource:       RIPE\n\n\nAs you can see, you also need a mntner for the key-cert object.\n\nThese are the fields of a key-cert object:\n\nkey-cert:       [mandatory]   [single]     [primary/lookup key]\nmethod:         [generated]   [single]     [ ]\nowner:          [generated]   [multiple]   [ ]\nfingerpr:       [generated]   [single]     [inverse key]\ncertif:         [mandatory]   [multiple]   [ ]\norg:            [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\nremarks:        [optional]    [multiple]   [ ]\nnotify:         [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\nadmin-c:        [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\ntech-c:         [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-by:         [mandatory]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\ncreated:        [generated]   [single]     [ ]\nlast-modified:  [generated]   [single]     [ ]\nsource:         [mandatory]   [single]     [ ]\n\n\nYou can use the text above as a template.\n\n# The Creation Process\n\nYou start the process of creating an irt object by sending a completed template by e-mail to the RIPE NCC. As creation of an irt object is a manual process, you should address your email to ripe-dbm@ripe.net\n\nIn your mail, you need to explain why you want to create a new irt object. To prevent misuse of the object, the RIPE NCC will need to check your request, so include a full explanation. A good idea is the listing of the inet(6)num objects you, as an IRT, are responsible for and from which you want to link to from your new irt object.\n\nYou will get a reply from the RIPE NCC asking you to acknowledge your request.\n\n\n# Creation Through the Trusted Introducer (TI) Service\n\nYou need to become a TI accredited team. The TI will register and maintain your IRT object.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nThis is the body of an example e-mail with which the TI creates object for a newly accredited team:\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nirt:        IRT-TCERT\naddress:    Telia AB, HQ\naddress:    TeliaCERT\naddress:    SE-123 86 Farsta\naddress:    Sweden\nphone:      +46 8 713 1872\nfax-no:     +46 706 175 101\ne-mail:     tcert@telia.se\nsignature:  PGPKEY-D47485CF\nencryption: PGPKEY-D47485CF\nadmin-c:    TI123-RIPE\ntech-c:     TI123-RIPE\nauth:       PGPKEY-D47485CF\nremarks:    Emergency telephone number +46 8 713 1872 (GMT+1/GMT+2 with DST)\nremarks:    http://www.trusted-introducer.org/teams/tcert.html\nremarks:    This is an accredited IRT (level 2)\nirt-nfy:    tcert@telia.se\nnotify:     tiirt@s-cure.nl\nnotify:     tcert@telia.se\nmnt-by:     TRUSTED-INTRODUCER-MNT\nsource:     RIPE\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.1 (MingW32) - WinPT 0.5.13\n\niD8DBQE/O1yZHxjOrs1gxBcRAn5TAJ9lBL4op6txrM17m1SF1pIIjptTTgCcCt4n\nP0fRecfQHzFxhvASPKfTt1Q=\n=Q9fl\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n\n# How to Link INET(6)NUM Objects to an IRT Object\n\n\n# Requirements\n\nTo link an inet(6)num object to an irt object you need:\n\n * The authorisation of the team the irt object belongs to\n * The authorisation of the maintainer of the inet(6)num object\n\nAuthorisation can be provided by a PGP signature, password or SSO account.

object\n\n\n# manual creation\n\n# requirements\n\nif you are an irt and want to create an irt object in the ripe database, you need to following:\n\n * a maintainer for that object. this should be a mntner object in the ripe database\n * a key-cert object in the ripe database containing a public pgp key\n * an ip address (range) for which you are responsible as an irt. this should be in the form of an inet(6)num object in the ripe database.\n * any other information that is mandatory for an irt object\n\n# the maintainer (mntner object)\n\na maintainer of an object in the ripe database is an entity, which can alone make changes to that object. a mntner object represents the maintainer. the maintainer authenticates change request either by using a pgp-key, password or sso account as specified in "auth:" attribute.\n\nif you as a team are responsible for a range of ip addresses, there almost certainly will be an inet(6)num object in the database. the maintainer of this object can also maintain your irt object.\n\nthe ripe ncc will not create a mntner object just for maintenance of an irt object.\n\n# the pgp key and the key-cert object\n\na pgp key for secure email communication is mandatory for an irt to create an irt object. before creating one, you will have to create a key-cert object matching your pgp key in the ripe database.\n\nyou can create one by sending a completed template by email to auto-dbm@ripe.net\n\nhere is an example:\n\nkey-cert:     pgpkey-6dfc4771\nmethod:       pgp\nowner:        dfn-cert (2003), encryption key \nfingerpr:     e8

template by e-mail to the ripe ncc. as creation of an irt object is a manual process, you should address your email to ripe-dbm@ripe.net\n\nin your mail, you need to explain why you want to create a new irt object. to prevent misuse of the object, the ripe ncc will need to check your request, so include a full explanation. a good idea is the listing of the inet(6)num objects you, as an irt, are responsible for and from which you want to link to from your new irt object.\n\nyou will get a reply from the ripe ncc asking you to acknowledge your request.\n\n\n# creation through the trusted

can be Force Deleted",content:'# Force Delete Functionality\n\nForce delete allows you to delete inet(6)num, route(6) and domain objects by using the maintainer of a covering address space object, instead of the maintainer of the object itself. This means the "mnt-lower:" of an allocation or the "mnt-by:" of a provider independent (PI) or anycast assignment or legacy under contract, each have the authority to force delete any more specific or related object.\n\nIn some cases it can occur that objects in the RIPE Database that fall under your address space have a maintainer that you do not control. For example, when you give joint control over an object to another user by using their "mnt-by:", you and the other party now have equal permissions. Now they have the ability to remove your maintainer from the object and take complete control. Another common issue is where an existing route object blocks the creation of a new exact matching route object.\n\nForce delete allows you to remove these objects even though you do not have the credentials for the maintainer on them. Instead, you can use the maintainer of the covering address space object, i.e. the "mnt-lower:" of the allocation or the "mnt-by:" of the PI or anycast assignment or legacy under contract.\n\nThere are very strict rules about which objects can be force deleted and whose authorisation is allowed to override the object\'s authorisation. Also keep in mind that it is only possible to delete objects: modifying them is not possible.\n\n\n# Authorisation to Force Delete\n\nNormally an object can only be deleted if the operation is authorised by one of the mntner objects in the "mnt-by:" attributes of the object to be deleted. With force delete, the RIPE Database also looks for the exact match, encompassing, or less specific address space object that was allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThe result is that in addition to the "mnt-by:" attribute of the object itself, the "mnt-lower:" of an allocation or the "mnt-by:" of a PI or anycast assignment or legacy under contract, each have the authority to force delete any more specific or related primary object.\n\n\n# Example of Force Delete\n\nThe force delete functionality only applies to holders of resources that are issued directly by the RIPE NCC. In the example below, the mntner object LIR-MNT can authorise the deletion of any of the objects shown, except for the allocation object itself. The holder of a sub-allocation does not have the authority to delete an assignment from that sub-allocation. So in this example, SUB-MNT cannot be used to delete the ASSIGNED PA block.\n\nThe same applies to the route and domain object in this example. Even though they fall under the sub-allocation, SUB-MNT cannot be used. Only LIR-MNT can force delete these objects.\n\nALLOCATED PA  \ninetnum: 10.128.0.0 - 10.128.255.255  \nmnt-by: RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT  \nmnt-lower: LIR-MNT  \nmnt-routes: LIR-RT-MNT  \n\nSUB-ALLOCATED PA  \ninetnum: 10.128.0.0 - 10.128.127.255  \nmnt-by: SUB-MNT  \nmnt-lower: SUB-MNT  \n\nroute: 10.128.0.0 - 10.128.127.255  \norigin: AS3333  \nmnt-by: AS3333-MNT  \n\nASSIGNED PA  \ninetnum: 10.128.1.0 - 10.128.1.255  \nmnt-by: END-MNT  \n\ndomain: 1.128.10.in-addr.arpa  \nmnt-by: END-MNT\n\n\n\n# Objects that can be Force Deleted\n\nNot all object types can be force deleted by a resource holder. Only the following primary object types are covered by this functionality:\n\n * inetnum\n * inet6num\n * route\n * route6\n * domain\n\nFor inetnum and inet6num object types, all objects more specific to an allocation made by the RIPE NCC are included, regardless of their status. The parent allocation object itself is not included as it is managed by the RIPE NCC. Objects related to PI assignments are included but, again, the PI assignments themselves are not included as they are assigned by the RIPE NCC. Therefore, a resource holder cannot accidentally delete their own resource object.\n\nFor route and route6 object types, any route(6) objects with a prefix exactly matching or more specific to any resource allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC are included. Multiple route(6) objects with the same prefix, and different origins, are all included.\n\nReverse delegation domain objects, ending with ip6.arpa or in-addr.arpa, with a prefix exactly matching or more specific to any resource allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC, are included. ENUM domain objects are not included.\n\nAutonomous System Number objects are not included.

We suggest the Maximum Zone TTL of your zone data to be a fraction of your signature validity period. If the TTL would be of similar order as the signature validity period, then all RRsets fetched during the validity period would be cached until the signature expiration time.

As a result query load on authoritative servers would peak at signature expiration time, as this is also the time at which records simultaneously expire from caches. To avoid query load peaks we suggest the TTL on all the RRs in your zone to be at least a few times smaller than your signature validity period.

This can be delegated.\n * Authentication - To ensure that the entity making use of the authorisation is what or who it claims to be.\n * Credential - Something that shows an entity has a right to exercise authorisation, providing the basis for confidence.\n\nThese three words are often confused. When talking about the RIPE Database, an authenticated person may be granted or given a credential by a system administrator or official contact, authorising this person to access and manage objects in the database.\n\nDifferent types of objects in the database require different levels of protection. The server supports multiple authorisation methods. Because of the data model used by the RIPE Database, it is not always possible to identify who is making an update. The mntner objects only hold credentials – for example, encrypted password hashes or references to cryptographic keys.

you are using the web application you can automatically be authenticated in one mntner if that mntner is associated to your SSO account.\n * Client certificate: You can supply your own certificate, and it is checked against the queried object\'s mntner key-certs',normalizedContent:'# restful api queries\n\nqueries are supported by the restful api using the get method. there are two ways of using the api. one way looks up a specific object and only returns a single object. the other searches for objects matching specified criteria. the search may return large numbers of objects.\n\nthe possible values that you can specify for the accept/content-type header are:\n\n * application/xml for xml\n * application/json for json\n * text/plain for text\n\nclients can also append an extension of ".xml", ".json" or ".txt" to the request url path instead of setting an accept: header. the server will return a response in the appropriate format for that given extension. xml format is the default one.\n\n\n# rest api lookup\n\nthis can be done from the command line using a third party software package, from a script or in a browser. it will only return the one specific object requested. for lookups on address space, it will not return the encompassing object if the specified object does not exist. by default objects are filtered as described in filtering the query

For more details of the legal background, see the RIPE NCC Data Protection Report.\n\nPersonal information is contained in the person object. There may also be some personal information in some role objects. The access control mechanism built into the database software therefore applies to both person and role objects.\n\nThe access control mechanism used is based on the number of these objects that are returned in the results of any queries made. Limits are applied to the IP address of a user sending queries to the database server by any of the query methods. (See 'How to Query the RIPE Database' for more details of the methods.)\n\nSometimes an IP address may be acting as a proxy and submitting queries on behalf of other IP addresses (for example, a webserver providing an interface to the RIPE Database). The database software provides a facility for proxy operators, which allows accounting to be based on the IP address of the End Users using the proxy to query the RIPE Database, and not on the IP address of the proxy operator. This is done using the -V flag as follows:\n\n-V &lt;version&gt;,&lt;ip-address&gt;\n\n\n * <version> is a client tag that can be any text string chosen by the proxy operator. Operators often use a string, showing the version of the software that the proxy operator uses, or, sometimes, they use an identifying string for the proxy operator.\n * <ip-address> is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the End User that queries the database using the proxy service\n\nNot all users can operate a proxy service and use this -V flag. You must contact RIPE Database Administration\n[ripe-dbm _at_ ripe _dot_ net] and explain why you need this facility. If your request is approved, the IP address of the proxy server will be added to an access control list. The proxy operator can then use the -V flag, but only from the IP address stated in the request.\nAttempting to use the -V flag without approval, or from any IP address not on the access control list, may result in permanent denial of access to the RIPE Database. This denial of access will apply to the IP address that submits the query using the -V flag.\n\n\n# Blocking Access to the RIPE Database\n\nEach time a person or role object is returned as part of a query result, a counter increases. When it reaches the limit defined in the AUP, the query execution is aborted and the connection is terminated, displaying an error message to the client (see the section on Access errors in the RIPE Database Query Server Response Codes and Messages). There is also a separate counter, tracking the number of times your request is denied. Retrieving any other object type does not affect these counters.\n\nAny role object used for abuse contacts with an \"abuse-mailbox:\" attribute is an exception to this rule. No accounting is done on these objects.\n\nWe restrict access to the RIPE Database to stop people from using it to collect excessive amounts of contact data. If the number of personal contact objects returned by all your queries in a day (defined by UTC) from one IP address exceeds the limits defined in the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), that IP address's access will be blocked. If your access is blocked, you will unable to query the RIPE Database for any object types - you are not just blocked from accessing contact data objects. This temporary block will be automatically released at midnight (UTC) to allow querying to continue. There is also a limit on the number of times an IP address can be blocked and recover. When this limit is reached, that IP address is permanently blocked from accessing the RIPE Database. This permanent block will not be removed automatically.\n\nThere are many reasons why you could find yourself blocked from querying the RIPE Database. One is that you are mining the RIPE Database for contact data to use for non-agreed purposes. In this case, the denial of access is justified and your IP address will remain on the blocked list. However, there may be other reasons why your IP address has been blocked. Queries for object types other than person and role objects return contact information by default. Using the -r or --no-referenced query flag to prevent contact data being included in your query results turns off this default. Alternatively, you may have an error in a script that runs automatically, retrieving contact data that you did not know about.\n\nIf you believe there was a genuine error or mistake that led to a permanent block, you should contact the RIPE Database administrators, explaining the error and what steps you have taken to stop it happening again. The RIPE Database administrators will decide if the block will be removed. It will remain on record that this IP address has been permanently blocked and then unblocked.

(See the section 'Attributes in an Object' for more details) This is the most basic type of query that can be made in the RIPE Database. Based on the primary key, a very specific instance of an object type can be queried. In almost all cases, a query on a primary key will only return a single object (assuming the query has not selected to include directly referenced objects). In most of those situations, that object will have a primary key that exactly matches the query argument. For example, querying for ‘aardvark-mnt' will only return the mntner object that has this as its primary key. In this example, you cannot query for a random part of the primary key. For example querying for ‘aardv' will not return this object. However if you query for ‘aardvark', you will not return this mntner object, but you will return any object containing the word ‘aardvark' in a lookup attribute.\n\nIn some cases, with hierarchical primary key values, the returned object may not exactly match the query argument. For example, if you query for ‘193.0.7.35' the returned inetnum object has the primary key value of ‘193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255'. Where address space is concerned, route(6) objects are usually returned with the address space object. So, in this case, you not only get objects with different primary keys, but also more than one object could be possibly returned in the query response.\n\nMany objects also have lookup keys. (See attribute section on 'Indexed' for more details.) These are used for search type queries. If you query for ‘aardvark', the response will include any object where the word ‘aardvark' has been used in any attribute value of a lookup key, as well as any object where this is the primary key. For primary keys, the key would need to be an exact match with this word. A lookup key value only needs to include this word as part of the value. Individual words in lookup keys are separately indexed.\n\nThe terminology is a bit confusing. A query using a primary key is really a ‘lookup' for a specific object exactly matching the query argument. A query using the lookup keys is really a ‘search' for any objects containing the query argument.\n\nThere are several query flags that can filter or limit the objects contained in the response.\n\nExamples of all queries using primary and lookup keys are shown in the next table.

The prefix length is a whole number in the range 0-32 (for example 193.0.0.0/22 specifies the range of 1024 IPv4 addresses starting with,and including, 193.0.0.0).\n * For IPv6 address ranges, the prefix length must be in the range 0-128 and is a 128-bit whole number, written in hexadecimal groups of two bytes separated by colons and with the possible use of shorthand notation for strings of consecutive 0s.\n\nThe inetnum objects represent an IPv4 address space in range notation. The inet6num objects represent IPv6 address space in standard prefix notation.\n\nWhen you query the RIPE Database for information about IP addresses, you can specify query arguments with the following notations:\n\n * A prefix (IPv4 or IPv6).\n * An explicit range (IPv4 only).\n * A single IP address. This is interpreted as a range of just one address. For IPv4, this can be written in range notation using the same start and end address. It could also be written as a single address. For IPv6, this has a prefix length of 128 or again it could also be written as a single address.\n\nFor IPv4 address space, the query argument can be specified with either prefix or range notation. When prefix notation is used, the database software converts this into range notation. An information message is included in the query response showing the conversions performed. For IPv6 address space, the query argument can only be specified in prefix notation. The single IP address is accepted as a short hand notation for a prefix. See Table 2: Queries For IP Networks table\n\nWe use three terms in these types of queries. These are all defined relative to the specified(reference) range:\n\n * An exact match refers to a range that is identical to the reference range.\n * A more specific range is contained within the reference range and is smaller. It contains fewer IP addresses than the reference range. We also call this a sub range.\n * A less specific range contains the whole of the reference range and is bigger. It has a greater number of IP addresses than the reference range. We also call this an encompassing range.\n\nThere are a number of options that describe how you can retrieve different types of information relative to a particular range of IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) including more and less specific queries.\n\n\n# Default Queries for IP Network\n\nIf you do not specify one of the following IP related query flags, and your query argument is a range of IP addresses in any one notation, a RIPE Database server will try to find an object with an exact match range for the specified range. If found, the exact match range is returned. If an exact match range cannot be found, the server looks for the object with the smallest less specific range. This will be the smallest, existing, encompassing range.\n\n\n# Exact Match Queries\n\nIf you want to change the default behaviour so that the server returns only an object with an exact match range, you need to use the –x (or --exact) query flag. This flag stops the server from looking for any less specific ranges if no exact match range exists. Not even the smallest encompassing range will be returned. If no exact match range is found, no object will be returned in the query response.\n\n\n# More Specific Range Queries\n\nThese refer to queries qualified by the use of the -M and -m query flags.\n\nThese queries will return information about objects with ranges of IP addresses that are fully contained within the reference range specified in the query argument. The returned objects contain fewer addresses than the specified range. More specific range queries do not return the exact match range if it exists.\n\n * -M (or --all-more) - requests that the server should return all the sub-ranges that are completely contained within the reference range. When there are hierarchies of sub-ranges, all levels of the hierarchies will be returned down to the smallest sub-range in each hierarchy. Many objects can be returned.\n * -m (or --one-more) - requests that the server should return all the sub-ranges that are completely contained within the reference range. When there are hierarchies of sub-ranges, only the top level of the hierarchies will be returned. These are usually called one level more specific ranges. Many objects can be returned.\n\n\n# Less Specific Range Queries\n\nThese refer to queries qualified by the use of the -L and -l query flags.\n\nThese queries will return information about objects with ranges of IP addresses that fully contain the reference range specified in the query argument. The returned objects contain a greater number of addresses than the specified range.\n\n * -L (or --all-less) - requests that the server returns the object with an exact match range, if it exists, and all objects with ranges that are bigger than the reference range and that fully contain, or encompass, it. Many objects can be returned.\n\n * -l (or --one-less) - requests that the server does not return the object with an exact match range, if it exists. It returns only the object with the smallest range that is bigger than the reference range and that fully contains, or encompasses, it. This is usually referred to as the one level less specific range. Only one object can be returned.\n\n\n# Less Specific Range Queries For Referenced IRT Objects\n\nAn irt object represents a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). It includes contact and security information. It is optionally referenced from inet(6)num objects using the "mnt-irt:" attribute (even though the irt object is not a mntner object). This shows which CSIRT is responsible for handling computer and network incidents for that address range.\n\nA reference to an irt object does not only apply to the inet(6)num object that contains the reference. It also applies to all inet(6)num objects that are more specific to the one containing the reference. Not every inet(6)num object needs to contain a reference to the irt object. The irt reference only needs to be placed in the least specific encompassing object to apply to a whole hierarchy of objects. This makes it easier to apply and maintain.\n\nThere may be more than one inet(6)num object in a hierarchy referencing an irt object. In this case, the one referenced from the smallest encompassing object is the one that applies to the range in question.\n\nThere is a -c (or --irt) query flag to make it easy to find the inet(6)num object containing the reference to an irt object for any specific range.\n\nThis flag makes the server search up the hierarchy of less specific range objects from the range specified as the query argument. The search will stop when the first object is found containing a reference to an irt object. This can be either the specified range or an encompassing inet(6)num object at any level in a hierarchy. The query will return the inet(6)num object found for the range specified in the query argument. The referenced irt object found in the hierarchy will also be returned.\n\nSometimes, no inet(6)num object is found in the hierarchy that contains a reference to an irt object. In this case, the query response will only contain the inet(6)num object found for the range specified in the query argument.',normalizedContent:'# queries for ip networks\n\nthe ripe database provides information about ip networks allocated or assigned within the ripe ncc service region. this information is mainly stored as inetnum, inet6num, route and route6 objects. these objects store information about a single ip address or ranges of addresses.\n\nthe route and route6 objects use prefix notation to specify the single address or range of addresses about which they contain information.\n\n"prefix notation" specifies ranges using two parts: the prefix and its length.\n\n * for ipv4, the prefix is a 32-bit integer written in dotted quad notation with the value of the lowest ip address in the range. the prefix length is a whole number in the range 0-32 (for example 193.0.0.0/22 specifies the range of 1024 ipv4 addresses starting with,and including, 193.0.0.0).\n * for ipv6 address ranges, the prefix length must be in the range 0-128 and is a 128-bit whole number, written in hexadecimal groups of two bytes separated by colons and with the possible use of shorthand notation for strings of consecutive 0s.\n\nthe inetnum objects represent an ipv4 address space in range notation. the inet6num objects represent ipv6 address space in standard prefix notation.\n\nwhen you query the ripe database for information about ip addresses, you can specify query arguments with the following notations:\n\n * a prefix (ipv4 or ipv6).\n * an explicit range (ipv4 only).\n * a single ip address. this is interpreted as a range of just one address. for ipv4, this can be written in range notation using the same start and end address. it could also be written as a single address. for ipv6, this has a prefix length of 128 or again it could also be written as a single address.\n\nfor ipv4 address space, the query argument can be specified with either prefix or range notation. when prefix notation is used, the database software converts this into range notation. an information message is included in the query response showing the conversions performed. for ipv6 address space, the query argument can only be specified in prefix notation. the single ip address is accepted as a short hand notation for a prefix. see table 2: queries for ip networks table\n\nwe use three terms in these types of queries. these are all defined relative to the specified(reference) range:\n\n * an exact match refers to a range that is identical to the reference range.\n * a more specific range is contained within the reference range and is smaller. it contains fewer ip addresses than the reference range. we also call this a sub range.\n * a less specific range contains the whole of the reference range and is bigger. it has a greater number of ip addresses than the reference range. we also call this an encompassing range.\n\nthere are a number of options that describe how you can retrieve different types of information relative to a particular range of ip addresses (ipv4 or ipv6) including more and less specific queries.\n\n\n# default queries for ip network\n\nif you do not specify one of the following ip related query flags, and your query argument is a range of ip addresses in any one notation, a ripe database server will try to find an object with an exact match range for the specified range. if found, the exact match range is returned. if an exact match range cannot be found, the server looks for the object with the smallest less specific range. this will be the smallest, existing, encompassing range.\n\n\n# exact match queries\n\nif you want to change the default behaviour so that the server returns only an object with an exact match range, you need to use the –x (or --exact) query flag. this flag stops the server from looking for any less specific ranges if no exact match range exists. not even the smallest encompassing range will be returned. if no exact match range is found, no object will be returned in the query response.\n\n\n# more specific range queries\n\nthese refer to queries qualified by the use of the -m and -m query flags.\n\nthese queries will return information about objects with ranges of ip addresses that are fully contained within the reference range specified in the query argument. the returned objects contain fewer addresses than the specified range. more specific range queries do not return the exact match range if it exists.\n\n * -m (or --all-more) -

Limits are based on the IP address of a whois client sending queries to the database server. Sometimes an IP address may be acting as a proxy and submitting queries on behalf of other IP addresses (for example, a webserver providing an interface to the RIPE Database). The database server provides a facility for such proxy clients that allows accounting to be based on the IP address of the clients using the proxy to query the RIPE Database and not on the IP address of the proxy server. This is done using the -V flag as follows:\n\n-V <version>,<ipv4-address>\n\n\nwhere\n\n * <version> is a client tag that usually represent the software version that the proxy uses\n * <ipv4-address> is the IPv4 address of the client that queries the database using the proxy\n\nNot all users can use this -V flag. You must contact RIPE Database Administration and tell us why you need this facility. If we approve your request, we will add the IP address of the proxy server to an access control list. You can then use the -V flag, but only from your stated IP address.\n\nAttempting to use the -V flag without approval may result in permanent denial of access to the RIPE Database. This denial of access will apply to the IP address that submits the query.\n\nWe restrict access to stop people using the RIPE Database to collect excessive amounts of contact data. If the amount of contact data returned by all your queries in a day (defined by UTC) exceeds defined limits, a temporary block on access is applied to that IP address. This block will be automatically released at midnight (UTC) to allow querying to continue. There is also a limit on the number of times an IP address can be blocked and recover. When this limit is reached, that IP address is permanently blocked from accessing the RIPE Database. This permanent block will not be automatically removed. The limits are defined in the RIPE Database Acceptable Use Policy\n\nThere are many reasons why you could find yourself in this position. One is that you are mining the RIPE Database for contact data to use for non-agreed purposes. In this case, the denial of access is justified and your IP address will remain on the blocked list. However, there may be other reasons. Queries for object types other than person and role objects return contact information by default. Using the -r or --no-referenced flag to prevent contact data being included in your query results can turn of this default. Alternatively, you may have an error in a script that runs automatically, retrieving contact data that you did not know about. If you believe there was a genuine error or mistake that led to the permanent block, you need to contact RIPE Database Administration. Explain the error and tell us what steps you have taken to stop it happening again. RIPE Database Administration will decide whether to remove the block. It will remain on record that this IP address has been permanently blocked and unblocked. If another permanent block occurs, we will be less likely to consider removing it a second time.\n\nEach time a person or role object is retrieved, a counter increases. When it reaches the limit defined in the AUP, the query execution is aborted and the connection is terminated, displaying an error message to the client (see "Access errors" in Appendix C,RIPE Database Query Server Response Codes and Messages). Also a count of denials increases. Retrieving any other object type does not affect these counters.\n\nAny role object used for abuse contacts with an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute is exception to this rule. No accounting is done on these objects.\n\nThere is also a limit on the number of simultaneous connections from a host.

This can be of use operationally and statistically. It is possible to query the history of operational data objects that still exist. The available historical data stretches back to the most recent time that the object was (re-)created. If an object is created, modified several times, deleted, recreated and modified again, the available data for this object will cover the most recent creation and modification, as well as the date that it was deleted. This policy of not showing historical data for deleted objects is subject to change.\n\nFor the available historical data, a list can be requested showing the versions with a timestamp. Each of these versions of the object can then be queried. Also, a diff is available between versions. These historical query flags do not have a short format and can only be used from the command line. These query flags are not available through either the web query form or the RESTful API.\n\nAll timestamps use the UTC timezone.\n\nAny attribute containing email addresses is filtered out from the query response. These may no longer be related to the object and, also, the owner of the email address may not want to receive any further communications concerning this data. It is also not possible to query for historical personal data objects i.e. person and role.\n\n“—list-versions”\n\nThe response to this is a list of available object versions with a timestamp. This timestamp is the date that an update was processed by the database server to create this version of the object. It is a system-generated timestamp; it is not information supplied by the user. The format looks like this:\n\n$ whois --list-versions 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% Version history for INETNUM object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255"\n% You can use "--show-version rev#" to get an exact version of the object.\n\n% This object was deleted on 2003-03-17 13:03\n\nrev#  Date              Op.\n\n1     2003-03-17 13:15  ADD/UPD\n2     2003-04-12 08:32  ADD/UPD\n3     2003-05-22 13:20  ADD/UPD\n4     2004-10-22 14:43  ADD/UPD\n5     2004-10-31 03:08  ADD/UPD\n6     2006-02-21 16:46  ADD/UPD\n7     2009-12-02 13:27  ADD/UPD\n8     2009-12-02 13:49  ADD/UPD\n9     2010-03-17 15:00  ADD/UPD\n10    2011-02-17 12:11  ADD/UPD\n11    2013-03-19 16:24  ADD/UPD\n\n\nThe specified primary key must be an exact match for an object. In the above example, you cannot request the history for 193.0.7.35. Even though this is part of the above range, these queries work on objects not hierarchies. Although this object existed prior to 2003-03-17, that part of the history is not available as it was deleted on this date.\n\n“—show-version #n”\n\nThis query will return one version of an object from the history list. Taking version #10 from the above example, the query response will look like this:\n\n$ whois --show-version 10 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% Version 10 of object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255"\n% This version was a UPDATE operation on 2011-02-17 12:11\n% You can use "--list-versions" to get a list of versions for an object.\n\ninetnum:        193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\nnetname:        RIPE-NCC\ndescr:          RIPE Network Coordination Centre\ndescr:          Amsterdam, Netherlands\nremarks:        Used for RIPE NCC infrastructure.\ncountry:        NL\nadmin-c:        JDR-RIPE\nadmin-c:        BRD-RIPE\ntech-c:         OPS4-RIPE\nstatus:         ASSIGNED PI\nsource:         RIPE # Filtered\nmnt-by:         RIPE-NCC-MNT\nmnt-lower:      RIPE-NCC-MNT\n\n\n“--diff-versions version-number:version-number”\n\nThis query will return the textual difference between two versions from the history list.

Please note that running your own mirror is not supported!\n\n 3. Using IRRd with NRTMv4.\n    \n    This feature is in development and is subject to change.\n    \n    With this method the mirror database gets updated in near real time.\n    \n    This section outline the essential steps for configuring, initializing, and maintaining synchronisation using Snapshot Files and Delta Files. By following these protocols, mirror clients ensure accurate and timely updates of RIPE Database information, while maintaining security and integrity through cryptographic verification processes.\n    \n    * Install IRRd.\n    * Configure IRRd for NRTMv4: Modify your IRRd configuration to enable support for NRTMv4. This typically involves configuring the URLs for Snapshot Files, Delta Files, and the Update Notification File. Ensure that IRRd is set up to server these files over HTTPS.\n    \n    # NRTMv4 specific settings for the RIPE database\n    nrtm:\n       version: 4  # NRTMv4 version\n       url:\n          snapshot: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-snapshot  # URL for Snapshot Files\n          deltas: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-deltas      # URL for Delta Files\n          update_notification: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json  # URL for Update Notification File\n       keys:\n          public: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json.sig  # Path to the public key for signature verification\n    \n    \n    * Initialise IRRd: Initialise IRRd with the necessary IRR database that supports NRTMv4.

The server notifies to the user when this happens, to ensure that the client have a complete view or need to reinitialise.\n\n 1. A session ID (random v4 UUID) is generated. This token is unique for RIPE Database.\n 2. A new Snapshot is generated for version one, this Snapshot may be empty if the database is empty.\n 3. A new Update Notification File is generated with the same session ID created in the first step. The session ID is referencing the Update Notification File with the Snapshot. This first snapshot doesn\'t have any Delta.\n 4. We update the Update Notification File with the new contents.\n\nEach Database (i.e: RIPE and RIPE-NONAUTH) has separate session IDs, snapshots, deltas and Update Notification Files, even if published by the same server instance.\n\n\n# Publishing updates\n\n\n# Update Notification File\n\nThe Update Notification File is essential for mirror clients to determine changes between their local Database state and the RIPE Database. It provides:\n\n * Information on the Snapshot File and Delta Files.\n * Timestamp for freshness checking.\n\nThe Update Notification File ensure efficient and accurate synchronisation between the RIPE database and the client\'s database by providing clear metadata, previse change details, and robust validation mechanisms. Clients must rely on this file to maintain up-to-date copies of the RIPE Database.\n\n 1. nrtm_version: must be 4\n 2. timestamp: is adhered to RFC3339 format, providing an accurate timestamp of when the Update Notification File was generated.\n 3. type: must be "notification".\n 4. next_signing_key: (optional) if present, denotes that public key for future key rotation.\n 5. source: identifies the source (i.e: RIPE, RIPE-NONAUTH), ensuring consistency with the RIPE Database data.\n 6. session_id: It is a unique v4 UUID assigned to this session and source, crucial for synchronisation and tracking.\n 7. version: represents the latest version number, aligning with the highest version of the included snapshot and deltas.\n 8. snapshot: contains the details of the Snapshot File, including the version, URL foe retrieval, and SHA-256 hash for integrity verification.\n 9. deltas: List all Delta Files with their respective version numbers, URLs, and hashes ensuring sequential continuity and data integrity checks.\n\nMore information here.\n\n * Example:\n\n{\n  "nrtm_version": 4,\n  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T15:00:00Z",\n  "type": "notification",\n  "next_signing_key": "bnJ0..bXY0",\n  "source": "RIPE",\n  "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",\n  "version": 4,\n  "snapshot": {\n    "version": 3,\n    "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-snapshot.2.047595d0fae972fbed0c51b4a41c7a349e0c47bb.json.gz",\n    "hash": "9a..86"\n  },\n  "deltas": [\n    {\n      "version": 2,\n      "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-delta.1.784a2a65aba22e001fd25a1b9e8544e058fbc703.json",\n      "hash": "62..a2"\n    },\n    {\n      "version": 3,\n      "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-delta.2.0f681f07cfab5611f3681bf030ec9f6fa3442fb0.json",\n      "hash": "25..9a"\n    },\n    {\n      "version": 4,\n      "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-delta.3.d9c194acbb2cb0d4088c9d8a25d5871cdd802c79.json",\n      "hash": "b4..13"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n * URL:\n\nENVIRONMENT   PUBLIC KEY URL\nPROD          https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json\nRC            https://nrtm-rc.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json\n\n\n# Snapshot File\n\nThe Snapshot File contains the complete and current contents of the RIPE Database, and clients should use it to initialise or reinitialise their local Database copies.\n\nTo avoid issues where a client retrieves an Update Notification File just before it is updated, servers should retain old Snapshot Files for at least 5 minutes after a new Update Notification File is published. This allows clients to complete the retrieval of the snapshot without encountering inconsistencies.\n\nThe Snapshot File is formatted as JSON Text Sequences. It contains one or more records.

The delta file is always compared with the previous delta file, so there will never be a version 1. The first delta will be compared with the initialized snapshot and will have the version number 2.\n\nDelta Files are used to record changes to RPSL objects between snapshots. They ensure that clients can keep their databases synchronized with the source by applying only the changes that occurred since the last synchronization.\n\n 1.  If there have been changes, a Delta File is published each minute.\n 2.  All the changes are included, even if some cancel each other out, like an addition and deletion of the same object.\n 3.  Each Delta File have a version number one greater than the last Delta File or Snapshot File Version.\n 4.  All the changes are in order they occurred during the time frame.\n 5.  Deltas older than 24 hours will be removed, after generating a new one.\n 6.  Update Notification File will include the new Delta File and the updated database version.\n 7.  Must match the session_id of the Update Notification File.\n 8.  Must match the source of the Update Notification File.\n 9.  nrtm_version: must be set to 4.\n 10. type: must be delta.\n 11.

The key is available in the next_signing_key attribute in the notification file.\n\nWe provide the public key file on a separate server.\n\nENVIRONMENT   PUBLIC KEY URL\nPROD          https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/nrtmv4/nrtmv4_public_key.txt\nRC            https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/nrtmv4/nrtmv4_public_key_rc.txt\n\n\n# Key Rotation\n\nThe public key will rotate approximately once a year for security reasons. The process for in-band key rotation involves:\n\n 1. Generating and configuring a new key as the upcoming signing key.\n 2. Including this key in the next_signing_key field of the Update Notification File, which propagates to mirror clients within 24 hours.\n 3. Optionally refreshing the Notification Update File earlier.\n 4. Mirror clients store the new key from the next_signing_key field upon retrieving the Update Notification File.\n 5. After a week, the server operator makes the new key active and removes the old key. Future Notification Files will be signed with the new key and will not include a next_signing_key field.\n 6. If a client\'s signature validation fails, it must attempt to verify using the previously encountered next_signing_key and update its configuration if successful.',normalizedContent:'# near real time

Stream",content:'# Access to NRTM\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis document describes show to access a RIPE Near Real Time Mirror (NRTM) Database data stream from the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nNear Real Time Mirroring (NRTM) is a mechanism that allows any client to receive a stream of available data from a database on a server operated by the RIPE NCC. The client can receive this stream of data modification from the server in near real time. The server will determine what data is made available to the client. Some data will be excluded from the stream or modified before sending. This is described below. The client pulls available data from the server by submitting requests. These requests can be periodic or continuous. The client can be initialised to a known state and the data stream can then be requested to continue with updates from that point onwards. However, updates are only available from the server as a data stream for two weeks. If the client has requested no updates for this period, then the client will need to be reinitialised.\n\nThe NRTM database made available by the RIPE NCC does not include any custom software or proprietary database engine with which to utilise the data.\n\nNOTE that it is not possible for users to mirror any of the RIPE NCC mirrored databases (for instance, other RIR databases). If you need a NRTM data stream from any other source you must contact that source directly.\n\n\n# NRTM Protocols\n\nCurrently there are two versions of the NRTM protocols available, Version 2 and Version 3. There is backwards compatibility between the two versions.\n\nThe RIPE Database server generates a serial number every time it processes an update in the database. When generating these serial numbers, the server describes all modifications to the database in terms of two atomic operations: deletion and addition.\n\nVersion 2 sends some data from every serial in the data stream. Where the real data is excluded, dummy data must be sent to maintain the sequence of serials.\n\nVersion 3 adds the serial number after the operation command for each update in the data stream. This eliminates the need to send dummy objects to keep serials in sync.\n\nCurrently, either version can be used. It is possible to switch between the versions. We would recommend using version 3. This allows you to process a more condensed data stream, leading to a cleaner database without the clutter of excessive dummy objects.\n\n\n# Excluded Data\n\nThe RIPE NRTM Database made available by this service does not include the full set of data contained in the RIPE Database. It specifically excludes:\n\n * Personal data (person and role objects)\n * Organisation details (organisation object)\n * Security data (mntner object)\n * References to personal data (NIC Handles)\n\nFor both Version 2 and 3 of the NRTM protocol the mntner and organisation objects are replaced in the data stream by dummy data. These are placeholder objects. They still contain the primary key and other objects make references to these objects.\n\nIn Version 2 of the NRTM protocol, the person and role objects are also replaced in the data stream by dummy data. However, the same dummy person object replaces all person and role objects. All references in other objects to person and role objects will refer to this single dummy person object.\n\nIn Version 3 of the NRTM protocol, the person and role objects are completely omitted from the data stream. Because the serials are included with each object in the data stream, it is not necessary to maintain placeholders.\n\nIf a client is blocked from Whois for excessive querying of personal data, they will also be blocked from NRTM.\n\n\n# Initial Setup\n\nAn initial data set is available from our ftp site. It is available in two formats:\n\n * Individual data files\n * Single data file\n\nThe individual data files contain data for each object type in separate text files. The excluded data (described above) is not available from these files. The set of files can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/split\n\nAll the data from the "optional" attributes has been removed from the files for the organisation and mntner objects. All of the data from the "mandatory" attributes has been replaced with standard dummy data, except for the primary key value. So, for a mntner object, only the "mntner:" attribute will contain any real data. The files for person and role objects contain only a single dummy person object with the NIC Handle \'DUMY-RIPE\'.\n\nThe single file is a merged data set of all the individual data files in a single text file. It contains the excluded organisation and mntner objects as dummy objects and a single person and role dummy object. This can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.db.gz\n\nAll of these files are produced on a daily basis. Only the most recent file is available from the dtp site. Each database update has a serial number and these serials define the data pulled from an NRTM data stream. The latest update serial included in the data files is held in a separate text file on the FTP site: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/RIPE.CURRENTSERIAL\n\nYou will need this serial number to know which serial to start pulling from the NRTM data stream. Note that only update serials from the previous 14 days can be pulled from the RIPE NRTM Database server. If you have not pulled any data from the NRTM stream for more than 14 days, you will need to download the above text files again, reinitialise your database and start from the new serial number. You may want to keep track of the serials that you pull from the NRTM data stream. If you have any gaps that are older than 14 days, then you will need to download all the text files again.\n\n\n# Accessing the Data Stream\n\nTo receive data from the NRTM data stream you must first connect to the host server and then pull selected data from it.\n\nThe client must connect to the host whois.ripe.net at port 4444.\n\nWhen sending data to a client using the Version 2 protocol, the server will send one of two strings ("ADD" or "DEL") followed by two line-break characters (\\n\\n) and then the corresponding object. This will either be the object as it was before deletion or the object as it should appear after being created or modified. If an object already existing in the database follows the "ADD" string, the client software should treat this as a modification.\n\nWith the Version 3 protocol the serial follows the operation string ("ADD" or "DEL") on the same line. All other returned data is the same as for Version 2.\n\nAfter connecting to the server, the client can request data by using the -g query flag. The arguments to this query flag are: -g <source> :<NRTM_Protocol_version_#>:<first>-<last>\n\nwhere\n\n * <source> is the string that identifies the server database that is being mirrored (only RIPE is available).\n * <NRTM_protocol_version_#> is the version of the mirroring protocol that the <source> supports (this should be 2 or 3 for the source RIPE).\n * <first> is the lowest serial number requested.\n * <last> is the most recent serial number requested. If the keyword "LAST" is used, this tells the server to send all updates up to the most recent one available at the time of the request.\n\nThis is an example of accessing the NRTM data stream using telnet and pulling the serials from 11012700 to the latest available.\n\n$ telnet whois.ripe.net 4444\nTrying 193.0.0.135...\nConnected to whois.ripe.net.\nEscape character is \'^]\'.\n\n-g RIPE:3:11012700-LAST\n\n% Rights restricted by copyright.\n% See http://www.ripe.net/db/copyright.html\n\n%START Version: 3 RIPE 11012700-11012701\n\nDEL 11012701\n\ninetnum: 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\nnetname: RIPE-NCC\ndescr: RIPE Network Coordination Centre\ncountry: NL\nadmin-c: RIPE124-RIPE\ntech-c: RIPE124-RIPE\nstatus: ALLOCATED PA\nnotify: bit-bucket@ripe.net\nmnt-by: NAGIOS-MNT\ncreated: 2003-03-17T12:15:57Z\nlast-modified: 2017-12-04T14:42:31Z\nsource: RIPE\n\n\nA client may request a persistent connection by including the -k query flag with a mirroring request (-g query flag).

mvn clean install -Pall\n * functional tests: mvn clean install -Pendtoend\n\n\n# Release\n\nTo make a release: mvn clean install -Prelease\n\nTo perform a release: mvn clean release:prepare release:perform -Prelease\n\nPerforming a release updates version in pom.xml, commits+pushes to git, tried to push artifacts to repo, etc..., whereas making a release will simply make a shaded jar using the current version in pom.xml, nothing else.\n\nThe release jar will be created in whois-db/target/whois-db-<pom-xml-version>.jar\n\n\n# Configuring your IDE\n\n * Install IntelliJ IDEA http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/\n * Import project\n * Point to local whois git repository\n * Import using Maven pom\n\nIf there are compilation errors, make sure to perform a maven build first, since it will generate required sources:\n\nmvn clean install\n\n\n\n# Running whois from within Intellij\n\n * Ensure MariaDB and the needed databases are created and populated\n   \n   * See Getting Started on macOS for installation information.\n   * See Configure MariaDB for instructions how to create and grant user permission.\n   * See Installation instructions for instructions on how to create and populate needed databases.\n\n * Ensure whois/tools directory is populated with hazelcast.xml file.\n\n * Ensure a local property is available in tools directory. Copy whois/whois-commons/src/test/resources/whois.properties and whois/whois-commons/src/test/resources/log4j2.xml into whois/tools directory and ensure the following properties are updated to allow running locally, for example have the following:\n   \n   port.query=1043 port.api=1080 port.nrtm=1081\n\nAlso ensure database username and password matches what you have locally.

Let's say that the blocked IP is 192.168.0.1.\n\n  INSERT INTO ACL_LOCAL.acl_limit (prefix, daily_limit, comment, unlimited_connections)\n  VALUES\n  ('192.168.0.1/32', -1, 'a comment', 10000000);\n\n\nAlso make sure there is no other line with the same prefix (192.168.0.1/32) in this table.\n\nAlso run the following, just in case this IP is permanently denied:\n\n  DELETE FROM ACL_LOCAL.acl_denied WHERE prefix = '192.168.0.1/32'\n  DELETE FROM ACL_LOCAL.acl_event WHERE prefix = '192.168.0.1/32';\n\n\nIf MariaDB says that no row was affected, it is fine.\n\nIf your client has IPv6, use the IPv6/64 prefix.\n\nCommit the changes and in a couple of minutes the Whois server will pick it up and will not block that IP again.",normalizedContent:"# installation

To facilitate this, there is a dedicated object which is used to protect all other objects you manage: the maintainer. This page explains how to set up a maintainer for yourself and your organisation, as well as handling delegation of authorisation to other parties.\n\nThe maintainer (mntner) object is used to protect other objects in the RIPE Database. This is done by referring to the maintainer from the object you want to protect, using the "mnt-by:" attribute. The maintainer contains one or more authentication methods that you can use to authorise making changes to your objects.\n\n\n\nMaintainers are anonymous. Other than the authentication references they contain, there is nothing that ties them to a specific person, group or organisation. Authentication is handled as a "logical OR", meaning that if you know one of several credentials associated with a maintainer, you can make changes to the objects that refer to it. In the example above, two people can use their RIPE NCC Access (single sing-on) account to make changes to the inet6num object, or the PGP key can be used. Which authentication method is best for your use case is explained in a separate section: Protecting your data in the RIPE Database.\n\nMost commonly, a maintainer object is maintained by itself, meaning that the "mnt-by:" attribute of the maintainer refers to the same object. If you want to edit details, for example add or remove an authentication, you simply need to use one of the existing authentication methods. In the example above, one of the three authentications can be used to add a forth, such as new colleague joining the team.\n\nWhat makes the maintainer system flexible is the fact that you have a lot of freedom in: * The number of maintainer objects you create * The number of maintainers you refer to from each RIPE Database object * The kind and number of authentication methods you use in each maintainer * Delegation of authorisation to a specific person or group * Controlling what kind of objects a certain group can create (such as route(6), domain and inet(6)num objects)\n\nGiven this flexibility, you must ensure you make the right choices when setting up authorisation. There are some important concepts and best practices to keep in mind which are explained in each of the following sections.\n\n\n# The Default Maintainer\n\nIf you are an LIR and you have received Internet Number Resources, several objects are created by the RIPE NCC in the RIPE Database to reflect this. These objects are managed by the RIPE NCC, but you have control over some attributes, such as setting the administrative and technical contact person. In order to allow you to make these changes, an additional maintainer will be present on the object, the so-called "default" maintainer. You have to select this maintainer on the Account Details page and this will be reflected in the "mnt-by:" attribute on all existing and new objects that have joint responsibility: top level allocations for IP resources (inet(6)num and aut-num objects) and the organisation object. If you had a previous default maintainer the new default maintainer will replace your previous one.\n\nAfter selecting the default maintainer, you can change all of the attributes you could previously modify by using the Object Editors - such as technical, administrative and abuse contact details - Through the RIPE Database itself. You can use any update method you like, e.g. webupdates, syncupdates or email updates.\n\n\n# Personal Maintainers Versus Shared Maintainers\n\nWhen you first use the RIPE Database, you need to create some basic objects. Every object you create in the database must be maintained. That means you need a mntner object. This object must reference a role (or person) object as a contact. However, the role (or person) object must be maintained. Therefore, a user cannot create either of these two objects first using any of the usual update methods. This means when you start using the RIPE Database, you first step would be to create a role and maintainer pair for yourself.\n\nMost other objects, especially the ones that are related to your resources, should be editable by you and your colleagues in the IT department or Network Operations Centre. For these objects you should be using a single maintainer that is shared by a group of people. In most cases, this maintainer was created when you registered as a RIPE NCC member or became a resource holder in another way. If not, it is always possible to create a shared maintainer at a later point.\n\nKeep in mind that sharing a maintainer doesn\'t mean sharing the credentials as well, such as a password or a key. As explained earlier, a maintainer can contain multiple authentication attributes, so each person that has access to it can use their own set of credentials.\n\n\n# Delegating Authorisation Using Maintainers\n\nThe idea behind delegation of authorisation is that you can authorise a certain group (either within or outside your organisation) to create objects under a certain parent object that you control. For example, your can allow your colleagues who are responsible for the BGP routing configuration to create route(6) objects to register the announcement in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR), and nothing else. Likewise, you can authorise your DNS group to request Reverse Delegation by creating a domain object and nothing else.\n\nFor this purpose, three attributes exist:\n\n* "mnt-lower:", for hierarchical control over one level more specific objects\n* "mnt-routes:", for the creation of **route(6)** objects in the IRR\n* "mnt-domains:", for requesting Reverse Delegation of DNS by creating a **domain** object\n\n\nThe "mnt-lower:" attribute specifies an existing mntner object used for hierarchical authorisation. It controls creation of objects one level more specific in the hierarchy of an object type (this only applies to inetnum, inet6num, as-block, aut-num, route, route6, or domain objects).\n\nThe most common occurrence of the "mnt-lower:" attribute is in the IP address allocation(s) that you have received from the RIPE NCC. For example, if you are an LIR and you have an IPv6 allocation, it is represented in the RIPE Database as an inet6num object. Because the allocation is managed by the RIPE NCC, one of the "mnt-by:" attributes is set to RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT and the other is set by you after choosing the default maintainer. These are some of the attributes you would see:\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        LIR-ORG-RIPE\nstatus:     ALLOCATED\nmnt-by:     RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:     LIR-NOC-MNT \n\n\nThe RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT maintainer prevents you from making changes to some of the attributes that are part of the RIPE NCC\'s registry management, such as the "netname:". Your LIR\'s default maintainer allows you to make changes to attributes you manage, such as the "admin-c:" and "tech-c:". In addition, it allows you to create assignments, as well as route(6) and domain objects under this parent block. However, if you wish to delegate the creation of child resource objects to a separate group, you can do so by creating an additional maintainer for them and specify it as "mnt-lower:":\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        LIR-ORG-RIPE\nstatus:     ALLOCATED\nmnt-by:     RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:     LIR-NOC-MNT\nmnt-lower:  LIR-IPMGMT-MNT\n\n\nLikewise, you can delegate control over the creation of **route(6)**and domain objects by adding a "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attribute to the allocation. Keep in mind that you first have to select a default maintainer before you can do this. The resulting allocation object would look something like this:\n\ninet6num:    2001:db8::/32\norg:         LIR-ORG-RIPE\nstatus:      ALLOCATED\nmnt-by:      RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:      LIR-NOC-MNT\nmnt-lower:   LIR-IPMGMT-MNT\nmnt-routes:  LIR-RTRMGMT-MNT\nmnt-domains: LIR-DNSMGMT-MNT\n\n\nAfter you have done this, you can achieve fine-grained control over the creation of inet(6)num, route(6) and domain objects.\n\nIn this example, route and domain objects are managed by separate maintainers: LIR-RTRMGMT-MNT and LIR-DNSMGMT-MNT respectively, as specified in the allocation. IN addition, a "nt-lower:" was specified in the aggregate prefix for the broadband pool (2001:db8::/36). This allows for the creation of more specific objects below it by LIR-BROADBAND-MNT:\n\n\n\nIn general, keep in mind that when as inet(6)num, route(6) or a domain object is created, authentication is required from the parent object. If the parent has a "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" or "mnt-domains:" attribute, this is the mntner that will need to be authenticated against. Otherwise the parent "mnt-by:" attribute is used.',normalizedContent:'# ripe database security\n\na collection of documents designed to help with security of whois data stored in the ripe database\n\n

inet6num object. because the allocation is managed by the ripe ncc, one of the "mnt-by:" attributes is set to ripe-ncc-hm-mnt and the other is set by you after choosing the default maintainer. these are some of the attributes you would see:\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        lir-org-ripe\nstatus:     allocated\nmnt-by:     ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:     lir-noc-mnt \n\n\nthe ripe-ncc-hm-mnt maintainer prevents you from making changes to some of the attributes that are part of the ripe ncc\'s registry management, such as the "netname:". your lir\'s default maintainer allows you to make changes to attributes you manage, such as the "admin-c:" and "tech-c:". in addition, it allows you to create assignments, as well as route(6) and domain objects under this parent block. however, if you wish to delegate the creation of child resource objects to a separate group, you can do so by creating an additional maintainer for them and specify it as "mnt-lower:":\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        lir-org-ripe\nstatus:     allocated\nmnt-by:     ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:     lir-noc-mnt\nmnt-lower:  lir-ipmgmt-mnt\n\n\nlikewise, you can delegate control over the creation of **route(6)**and domain objects by adding a "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attribute to the allocation. keep in mind that you first have to select a default maintainer before you can do this. the resulting allocation object would look something like this:\n\ninet6num:    2001:db8::/32\norg:         lir-org-ripe\nstatus:      allocated\nmnt-by:      ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:      lir-noc-mnt\nmnt-lower:   lir-ipmgmt-mnt\nmnt-routes:  lir-rtrmgmt-mnt\nmnt-domains: lir-dnsmgmt-mnt\n\n\nafter you have done this, you can achieve fine-grained control over the creation of inet(6)num, route(6) and domain objects.\n\nin this example, route and domain objects are managed by separate maintainers: lir-rtrmgmt-mnt and lir-dnsmgmt-mnt respectively, as specified in the allocation. in addition, a "nt-lower:" was specified in the aggregate prefix for the broadband pool (2001:db8::/36). this allows for the creation of more specific objects below it by lir-broadband-mnt:\n\n\n\nin general, keep in mind that when as inet(6)num, route(6) or a domain object is created, authentication is required from the parent object. if the parent has a "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" or "mnt-domains:" attribute, this is the mntner that will need to be authenticated against. otherwise the parent "mnt-by:" attribute is used.',charsets:{},lastUpdated:"2024-05-31T14:37:29Z",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1717166249e3},{title:"Configuring Reverse

This process is also known as forward DNS resolution. Reverse DNS (rDNS) is the inverse process of this: the resolution of an IP address to its designated domain name. This document explains how reverse DNS works and how to configure it for your zone\n\n\n# Reverse DNS Overview\n\nThe reverse DNS database of the Internet works with a hierarchical tree of servers, just like forward DNS. It is rooted in the Address and Routing Parameter Area (arpa) top-level domain of the Internet. One level below the arpa root are the delegated servers in-addr.arpa for IPv4 and ip6.arpa for IPv6.\n\nFurther down the tree, there are delegations for the /8 blocks that IANA allocated to the RIRs, the allocations that the RIRs gave to the address holders, all the way down to the individual IP addresses and names that you have configured for your Internet-enabled hosts. The process of reverse resolving an IP address uses the pointer DNS record type (PTR record).\n\n\n\nIn order to do a DNS lookup for data that is associated with a certain IP address, you should map the IP addresses into the DNS name hierarchy. This means that, as an address holder, you will have to configure two things. Forst, you have to configure your zone for reverse DNS. Second, you have to request reverse delegation of your zone. The second part is one by creating a domain bject in the RIPE Database.\n\nBefore you can submit the domain object to the RIPE Database, you will first have to configure reverse DNS for your zone on at least two name servers. Upon submission, the RIPE Database will perform checks to see if your name servers are configured properly. If so, delegation will be propagated to the DNS by the RIPE NCC\'s name servers.\n\n\n# Mapping IP addresses into the DNS name hierarchy\n\nFor IPv4, the mapping of the reverse address space can only happen on "byte" boundaries, i.e. multiples of 8 bits. This means that you should take the four octets - the decimal numbers between the dots - of an IP address range, put them in reverse order and then map them into the in-addr.arpa domain.\n\nFor example, an address (A) record for mail.example.com points to the IP address 192.0.2.5. In pointer record of the reverse database, this IP address is stored as the domain name 5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. pointing back to its designated host name mail.example.com. The resulting PTR record would look like this:\n\n5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. 3600 IN PTR mail.example.com\n\n\nReverse DNS for IPv6 uses the hexadecimal notation on "nibble" boundaries, i.e. multiples of 4 bits. This means you should take the IPv6 address, expand all the zerps, put each hexadecimal number in reverse order and map them into the ip6.arpa domain.\n\nFor example, the pointer domain name corresponding to the IPv6 address 2001:db8::567:89ab is b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa., which would result in this PTR record:\n\nb.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. 3600 IN PTR mail.example.com.\n\n\n\n# Dealing with multiple zones for one address block\n\nBecause the particular mapping delegation of reverse address space can only happen on byte boundaries for IPv4 and nibble boundaries for IPv6, you could be dealing with multiple zones for one address block.\n\nIPv4 One or more /24 type zones need to be created if your address space has a prefix length between /17 and /24. If your prefix length is between /16 and /9 you will have to request one or more delegations for /16 type zones.\n\nFor example, if you have been allocated 10.155.16.0/22, you need to create four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nIPv6 If you have been allocated an IPv6 block that is not on a nibble boundary, you will need to go down to the next nibble and create multiple zones to cover the entire block.\n\nFor example, an allocation such as 2001:db8::/29 will result in eight reverse zones of /32 each:\n\n8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n9.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\na.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nb.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nc.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nd.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\ne.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nf.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n\n\n\n# Creating DOMAIN Objects for Reverse DNS\n\n\n# Step 1: Set up authorisation\n\nThe creation and maintenance of domain objects must be handled by a designated maintainer. You can use an existing maintainer or create a specific one for the people who will be creating and managing domain objects. You should refer to this maintainer using the "mnt-domains:" attribute in inetnum object for the address block that you hold. You will be able to add the "mnt-domains:" attribute in the RIPE Database, for example using webupdates. If you are an LIR, you may need to select your default maintainer first, before you can add this attribute.\n\n\n# Step 2: Configure your DNS server\n\nConfigure your DNS servers in such a way that you will pass all the tests that we will perform. Here are some recommendations to help you:\n\n * Make sure you set up at least two name servers that are authoritative for the zone\n * Ensure that the servers are at least in different subnets, but preferably in different networks that are geographically distributed.\n * The resolvable names of these name servers should be in the NS resource records of the zone.\n * The SOA resource record (RR) should have the same content, both serial number and other data, on all the name servers.\n * The SOA should contain a valid "RNAME" (the contact address)\n * The timing parameters should be reasonable\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your configuration, we recommend that you perform a test fo your setup using the DNSCheck tool so you can find and resolve any problems.\n\n\n# Step 3a: Create your domain objects using webupdates\n\nWhen you submit a domain object you are requesting reverse delegation, asking the RIPE NCC to enter NS records pointing to your name servers in RIPE NCC\'s parent zone. The domain object has the following mandatory attributes:\n\ndomain:   <zone name>\nadmin-c:  <nic-handle for administrative contact>\ntech-c:   <nic-handle for technical contact>\nzone-c:   <nic-handle for zone contact>\nnserver:  <primary name server>\nnserver:  <secondary name server>\nmnt-by:   <your maintainer>\nsource:   RIPE\n\n\nIn the web interface for the RIPE Database, there is a wizard that will automatically create one or more domain objects for you. It allows you to fill in an IPv4 or IPv6 prefix and the wizard will take care of creating one or multiple reverse zones out of it. After filling in your name servers, the wizard will also perform a basic check to see if the name servers are online. The full set of tests will happen after you submit the form. A one-minute video with a demonstration is available online.\n\n\n\nAfter you have entered all of the required fields you can submit the form. Depending on the amount of domain objects that are going to be created, it can take up to several minutes for the process to complete. The tests return log level information, categorised as INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL. We reject any update that has ERROR or CRITICAL for any test. If this happens to you, resolve the problem and try completing the wizard again.\n\nIf the update was successful, the success page will show you the first couple of domain objects that were created, along with a link to the full list. Still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the DNS. The ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# Step 3b: Create your domain objects using syncupdates, email or the API\n\nIf you choose to create domain objects using syncupdates, email or the API, you will first need to chop your address block into "chunks" that can be delegated. For example, if you have been allocated 10.155.16/22, you need to create four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nIn the "domain:" attribute, you specify the name of the reverse zone, e.g. "16.155.10.in-addr.arpa". As discussed, you will have to do this for each "chunk" you have created. If you need reverse delegation for a /22 block, you will need to create four domain objects, one for each /24.\n\nEnter all other attributes and submit your domain object to the RIPE Database. After verifying syntax and authorisation, we will perform a number of tests to see if you configured reverse DNS correctly. The tests return log level information, categorised as INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL. We reject any update that has ERROR or CRITICAL for any test. If this happens to you, resolve the problem and try submitting the domain object again.\n\nIf the update was successful, you should then be able to query for your object in the RIPE Database. Still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the DNS. The ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# Requesting DNSSEC Delegations\n\nTo allow for the exchange of DNSSEC-related information, the domain object includes a "ds-rdata:" attribute.\n\nIn DNSSEC, the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record is created from a DNSkey resource record by comparing it with the public key. The parent publishes the DS resource record. The "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the RDATA of the DS resource records related to the domain, as shown in the "domain:" attribute.\n\nds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278BF194C29A812B33935BB2517E17D1486210FA\n\n\nThe tools provided with BIND (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. You should copy the DS RDATA into the "ds-data:" attributes.\n\nWhen we receive a domain object with DNSSEC-related information, we will carry out additional tests.\n\n\n# Automated update of DNSSEC Delegations\n\nWhenever you want to change the DNSSEC key whose digest is in the "ds-rdata:" attribute, it is necessary to update the attribute. This can be done manually using any means of RIPE Database update methods or automatically using a special Child Delegation Signed (CDS) DNS record. This procedure works as follows:\n\n * The reverse domain has to be already DNSSEC-secured.\n * Whenever a change in "ds-rdata:" attribute is required, you should publish a CDS record at the apex (root) of your reverse zone.\n * RIPE NCC regularly scans all DNSSEC-secured reverse domains for CDS records.\n * If a CDS record is found whose contents differ from the current "ds-rdata:" attribute and all safety measures (see below) are fulfilled, RIPE NCC will update the domain object on your behalf.\n\nThere are some additional requirements mandated by RFC 7344 in order to ensure the process is hardened against accidents and abuse:\n\n * The CDS record set is properly signed by a key represented in the DS record of the parent zone. This usually means that the CDS record set has to be signed by Key-Signing Key (KSK) instead of Zone-Signing Key (ZSK).\n * Applying the CDS record must not break the DNSSEC delegation. Therefore for each DNSSEC algorithm present in the CDS record set, there has to be at least one matching key in the DNSKEY record set with a proper signature.\n * The inception date of the DNSSEC signature of the CDS record set must not be older than the date stored in the "last- modified:" attribute of the domain object.\n\nIt is also possible to switch to insecure delegation by publishing a special CDS record containing "0 0 0 00". Please note that this is a one way process. Once the reverse domain is switched to insecure, you have to add the "ds-rdata:" attribute manually to activate DNSSEC again.\n\n\n# Reverse DNS Troubleshooting\n\nHere is an overview of the most common warnings and errors that the reverse delegation checker reports, along with the likely causes and suggested solutions.\n\nERROR                                                         LIKELY CAUSE AND SUGGESTED SOLUTION\nERROR: No SOA RR were found.

four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nipv6 if you have been allocated an ipv6 block that is not on a nibble boundary, you will need to go down to the next nibble and create multiple zones to cover the entire block.\n\nfor example, an allocation such as 2001:db8::/29 will result in eight reverse zones of /32 each:\n\n8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n9.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\na.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nb.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nc.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nd.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\ne.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nf.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n\n\n\n# creating domain objects for reverse dns\n\n\n# step 1: set up authorisation\n\nthe creation and maintenance of domain objects must be handled by a designated maintainer. you can use an existing maintainer or create a specific one for the people who will be creating and managing domain objects. you should refer to this maintainer using the "mnt-domains:" attribute in inetnum object for the address block that you hold. you will be able to add the "mnt-domains:" attribute in the ripe database, for example using webupdates. if you are an lir, you may need to select your default maintainer first, before you can add this attribute.\n\n\n# step 2: configure your dns server\n\nconfigure your dns servers in such a way that you will pass all the tests that we will perform. here are some recommendations to help you:\n\n * make sure you set up at least two name servers that are authoritative for the zone\n * ensure that the servers are at least in different subnets, but preferably in different networks that are geographically distributed.\n * the resolvable names of these name servers should be in the ns resource records of the zone.\n * the soa resource record (rr) should have the same content, both serial number and other data, on all the name servers.\n * the soa should contain a valid "rname" (the contact address)\n * the timing parameters should be reasonable\n\nwhen you are satisfied with your configuration, we recommend that you perform a test fo your setup using the dnscheck tool so you can find and resolve any problems.\n\n\n# step 3a: create your domain objects using webupdates\n\nwhen you submit a domain object you are requesting reverse delegation, asking the ripe ncc to enter ns records pointing to your name servers in ripe ncc\'s parent zone. the domain object has the following mandatory attributes:\n\ndomain:   <zone name>\nadmin-c:  <nic-handle for administrative contact>\ntech-c:   <nic-handle for technical contact>\nzone-c:   <nic-handle for zone contact>\nnserver:  <primary name server>\nnserver:  <secondary name server>\nmnt-by:   <your maintainer>\nsource:   ripe\n\n\nin the web interface for the ripe database, there is a wizard that will automatically create one or more domain objects for you. it allows you to fill in an ipv4 or ipv6 prefix and the wizard will take care of creating one or multiple reverse zones out of it. after filling in your name servers, the wizard will also perform a basic check to see if the name servers are online. the full set of tests will happen after you submit the form. a one-minute video with a demonstration is available online.\n\n\n\nafter you have entered all of the required fields you can submit the form. depending on the amount of domain objects that are going to be created, it can take up to several minutes for the process to complete. the tests return log level information, categorised as info, notice, warning, error and critical. we reject any update that has error or critical for any test. if this happens to you, resolve the problem and try completing the wizard again.\n\nif the update was successful, the success page will show you the first couple of domain objects that were created, along with a link to the full list. still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the dns. the ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# step 3b: create your domain objects using syncupdates, email or the api\n\nif you choose to create domain objects using syncupdates, email or the api, you will first need to chop your address block into "chunks" that can be delegated. for example, if you have been allocated 10.155.16/22, you need to create four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nin the "domain:" attribute, you specify the name of the reverse zone, e.g. "16.155.10.in-addr.arpa". as discussed, you will have to do this for each "chunk" you have created. if you need reverse delegation for a /22 block, you will need to create four domain objects, one for each /24.\n\nenter all other attributes and submit your domain object to the ripe database. after verifying syntax and authorisation, we will perform a number of tests to see if you configured reverse dns correctly. the tests return log level information, categorised as info, notice, warning, error and critical. we reject any update that has error or critical for any test. if this happens to you, resolve the problem and try submitting the domain object again.\n\nif the update was successful, you should then be able to query for your object in the ripe database. still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the dns. the ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# requesting dnssec delegations\n\nto allow for the exchange of dnssec-related information, the domain object includes a "ds-rdata:" attribute.\n\nin dnssec, the delegation signer (ds) resource record is created from a dnskey resource record by comparing it with the public key. the parent publishes the ds resource record. the "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the rdata of the ds resource records related to the domain, as shown in the "domain:" attribute.\n\nds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278bf194c29a812b33935bb2517e17d1486210fa\n\n\nthe tools provided with bind (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. you should copy the ds rdata into the "ds-data:" attributes.\n\nwhen we receive a domain object with dnssec-related information, we will carry out additional tests.\n\n\n# automated update of dnssec delegations\n\nwhenever you want to change the dnssec key whose digest is in the "ds-rdata:" attribute, it is necessary to update the attribute. this can be done manually using any means of ripe database update methods or automatically using a special child delegation signed (cds) dns record. this procedure works as follows:\n\n * the reverse domain has to be already dnssec-secured.\n * whenever a change in "ds-rdata:" attribute is required, you should publish a cds record at the apex (root) of your reverse zone.\n * ripe ncc regularly scans all dnssec-secured reverse domains for cds records.\n * if a cds record is found whose contents differ from the current "ds-rdata:" attribute and all safety measures (see below) are fulfilled, ripe ncc will update the domain object on your behalf.\n\nthere are some additional requirements mandated by rfc 7344 in order to ensure the process is hardened against accidents and abuse:\n\n * the cds record set is properly signed by a key represented in the ds record of the parent zone. this usually means that the cds record set has to be signed by key-signing key (ksk) instead of zone-signing key (zsk).\n * applying the cds record must not break the dnssec delegation. therefore for each dnssec algorithm present in the cds record set, there has to be at least one matching key in the dnskey record set with a proper signature.\n * the inception date of the dnssec signature of the cds record set must not be older than the date stored in the "last- modified:" attribute of the domain object.\n\nit is also possible to switch to insecure delegation by publishing a special cds record containing "0 0 0 00". please note that this is a one way process. once the reverse domain is switched to insecure, you have to add the "ds-rdata:" attribute manually to activate dnssec again.\n\n\n# reverse dns troubleshooting\n\nhere is an overview of the most common warnings and errors that the reverse delegation checker reports, along with the likely causes and suggested solutions.\n\nerror                                                         likely cause and suggested

Many of the operational responsibilities for data handling are delegated to the individuals who have mntner objects in the database. These individuals, or Maintainers, maintain sets of data related to their IP network operations.\n\nIf one of these Maintainers fails to fulfill their Data Protection responsibilities, the RIPE NCC could have a legal obligation to intervene. This may require the RIPE NCC to modify or delete personal Contact Details. The procedure outlined in this document balances maintaining accountability with the privacy rights of individuals.\n\n\n# Definitions\n\nIn this document, the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nRIPE NCC – Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre. A membership association under Dutch law operating its registered office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nRIPE Community – RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide area IP networks in Europe and beyond. The objective of RIPE is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-European IP network.\n\nUpdate – submitting information for entry into or removal from the RIPE Database.\n\nInternet number resource – globally unique address space (IPv4 and IPv6) and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) issued by any Internet Number Registry.\n\nPrimary objects – Internet number resources and other data object types that are not directly related to any other Primary object type and which are defined by Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) or which have been agreed by the RIPE Community as acceptable primary data.\n\nRIPE Database – the publicly available data collection of Internet Number Registry (INR) and Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data published by the RIPE NCC. It contains all the Primary and Secondary objects. There is also some non-public data required for the operation of the RIPE Database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the RIPE Database.\n\nRegistrant – a natural person or legal entity to whom an Internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other Primary object in the RIPE Database by specific or general agreement with the RIPE NCC.\n\nMaintainer – any Registrant or person to whom the authority to Update has been delegated by a Registrant, either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\nEnd User – a person for whom an Internet number resource has been registered for their use.\n\nData Subject – a natural person whose personal Contact Details or other personal data are recorded in the RIPE Database.\n\nContact Details – all details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, e-mail or any other form of electronic communication that is used by a natural person or a legal entity.\n\nPersonal Contact Details – Contact Details pertaining to a natural person.\n\nInternet Registry – Any registry that makes Internet number resources available to other people and records information in a database about the Registrant.\n\n\n# General\n\nPersonal Contact Details are held in several object types (see Appendix G) The person object is the starting point for all data sets in the RIPE Database and this procedure will focus on these objects.\n\nChanges to Personal Contact Details can have significant consequences. To change or remove Personal Contact Details may require:\n\n * References to be removed from other objects.\n * Some other objects to be deleted.\n * Internet number resources to be returned to the appropriate Internet Registry.\n * Registrant/Maintainer to lose control and/or right of usage of the Internet number resource.\n\nThe precise course of action depends on the type of object in which the person object is referenced. The RIPE NCC has a legal obligation to remove Personal Contact Details on request from the Data Subject in some situations.\n\nIf the Data Subject is the Registrant of an Internet number resource and wishes to remain the Registrant of that resource, the following options are available:\n\n * Insert Personal Contact Details for some other person from the Data Subject’s organisation.\n * Insert Contact Details related to the Maintainer of the resource if this is not the Data Subject. This option is only available if the Maintainer agrees or if the Maintainer is also the Registrant.\n * Insert Contact Details related to the organisation responsible for the parent resource (provided that this is not the RIPE NCC). In this case, responsibility for maintaining the data should also pass to this parent resource organisation if they are not already the Maintainer. This option is only available if the parent resource organisation agrees.\n * Deny the request to remove Personal Contact Details if the Data Subject is the Registrant and does not wish to return the Internet number resource, or the Data Subject is the Maintainer and does not wish to release control over the resource and none of the above options are available.\n\nThe Data Subject needs to be aware of the consequences of removing Personal Contact Details where the options above are not possible or acceptable. The Data Subject cannot maintain an Internet number resource and be anonymous. Where accountability for registrations of global resources conflicts with an individual’s right to privacy, drastic action may be required. This may involve returning Internet number resources to the Internet Registry that issued them and removing all associated data from the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Procedure\n\nThe RIPE NCC has tried to clearly identify a series of steps that can be taken at different stages. The aim is to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all parties and protect everyone’s interests while maintaining the RIPE NCC’s responsibility as a public registry of Internet number resources. The RIPE NCC will always inform the Data Subject within four weeks in writing whether a request for change or removal of Personal Contact Details will be granted. If the request is denied, the RIPE NCC will duly motivate this decision. This procedure refers only to person objects for clarity, but other objects may be involved (see Appendix G).\n\nThe steps that will be taken are as follows:\n\n 1. The RIPE NCC is contacted by a Data Subject asking for their Personal Contact Details to be removed from the RIPE Database. The Data Subject must clearly identify the details they are referring to by sending a copy of the Personal Contact Details to the RIPE NCC.\n 2. The RIPE NCC forwards the request to the Maintainer of the person object and copies the Data Subject on the\n    e-mail. The Maintainer is asked to resolve the issue within ten working days and send confirmation to both the RIPE NCC and the Data Subject.\n 3. a. If the RIPE NCC receives confirmation from the Maintainer that action has been taken, the RIPE NCC notifies both the Maintainer and the Data Subject that the case is closed.\n    b. If no confirmation is received from the Maintainer, but the person object has been deleted or substantially changed, the RIPE NCC notifies both the Maintainer and the Data Subject that the issue has been resolved and the case is closed.\n    c. If no confirmation is received from the Maintainer, and nothing has changed, the RIPE NCC contacts the Data Subject and copies the message to the Maintainer. The Data Subject is asked to confirm that they still want the personal Contact Details removed. If they confirm this, the RIPE NCC moves to Step 4 (below).\n\nThe following steps are the actions the RIPE NCC will take when the Maintainer does not respond to or does not comply with the request to change or remove Contact Details:\n\n 4. The RIPE NCC asks the Data Subject for a copy of a legal identification document. This document must match the personal Contact Details to be removed. This should be faxed to the RIPE NCC together with a formal request for the removal of the personal Contact Details.\n 5. The RIPE NCC receives the signed request and identification document from the Data Subject.\n 6. If it is a simple case where:\n    * The person object is unreferenced.\n    * Each object referencing the person object references more than one person object.\n 7. For a simple case, the RIPE NCC sends an acknowledgement to the Data Subject and the Maintainer informing them that the personal Contact Details have been removed and the case is closed.\n\nFor anything other than one of the simple cases, the RIPE NCC continues with the following steps:\n\n 8.  The RIPE NCC sends a statement to the Data Subject of actions to be taken, which includes a list of any other data that may be affected which is directly related to the person object and the changes that need to be made to this data. This list will highlight any resources that will need to be returned to an Internet Registry or transferred to another Maintainer and the possible consequences of this action. These consequences may include the removal of some data from the RIPE Database.\n\n 9.  Because of the referential integrity rules, when any data is removed from the RIPE Database, there can be a chain reaction. This may result in more data being changed or removed. The Maintainers of any such data will be informed and requested to make the appropriate changes. These changes will have to be made before the Data Subject's details can be removed because no object can be deleted from the RIPE Database while it is still referenced.\n\n 10. If there is an option for data to be transferred to another Maintainer but the latter Maintainer is not willing to be the Maintainer of this data, then there are only two options available:\n     \n     * The User must return the resource to the appropriate Internet registry and their personal Contact Details will be removed.\n     * The User’s personal Contact Details cannot be removed but can be corrected if there is an error.\n     \n     In the former case, if the Data Subject confirms the action, the RIPE NCC moves into the clean-up phase. In the latter case, any corrections will be applied and the case is closed.\n\n 11. a. If the Data Subject confirms the action in the statement, the RIPE NCC moves into the clean-up phase.\n     b. If the Data Subject does not confirm this action, no further action is possible and the case is closed.\n\n\n# Clean-up Phase\n\nThis is the procedure taken by the RIPE NCC when the removal of personal Contact Details is not a simple case. The actual implementation is very technical and requires some recursive searching for references.\n\nThe goal is to remove the person object containing the Data Subject’s personal Contact Details. All reference chains must be followed and appropriate changes made as close in the chain as possible to the person object to maintain the referential integrity of the RIPE Database.\n\nIf an object needs to be deleted, special considerations may apply, depending on the object type (see Appendix F). This may involve returning some resources to the appropriate Internet Registries. If these resources are registered to the Data Subject requesting the removal of personal Contact Details, the resources will be listed in the statement to the Data Subject together with the consequences. If the resources are managed by other Maintainers, the Maintainers will be notified and given an opportunity to change the references and take their resources off the list of affected objects. This must be done before the Data Subject’s personal Contact Details can be removed.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt is easier for all concerned if the Maintainers make any necessary changes to the personal Contact Details. The Maintainers are closer to the people involved and have a better understanding of how to replace references to the Data Subject. If the RIPE NCC has to make changes it is because the Maintainer of the data has not responded in a timely manner. In this case, the drastic actions detailed in this procedure, including requiring resources to be returned, are necessary.\n\nBecause the procedure requires drastic actions in some cases, it is important that the RIPE NCC can contact the right people to inform them of the actions in advance. Currently, the RIPE NCC has no authoritative contact details for the Maintainer of many sets of data objects. The RIPE NCC only has the set of e-mail addresses listed in the objects in the RIPE Database. Few of these have been verified and some may prove to be invalid. The RIPE NCC will consider the Maintainer to have been informed by sending an e-mail to the address listed in the RIPE Database.",normalizedContent:"# procedure for the removal of personal contact details\n\n\n# introduction\n\nthe ripe ncc is authorised by the ripe community to act as the registration authority and keep an accurate register of internet number resources in its service region and to manage the operation of the ripe database. many of the operational responsibilities for data handling are delegated to the individuals who have mntner objects in the database. these individuals, or maintainers, maintain sets of data related to their ip network operations.\n\nif one of these maintainers fails to fulfill their data protection responsibilities, the ripe ncc could have a legal obligation to intervene. this may require the ripe ncc to modify or delete personal contact details. the procedure outlined in this document balances maintaining accountability with the privacy rights of individuals.\n\n\n# definitions\n\nin this document, the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nripe ncc – reseaux ip europeens network coordination centre. a membership association under dutch law operating its registered office in amsterdam, the netherlands.\n\nripe community – ripe (reseaux ip europeens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide area ip networks in europe and beyond. the objective of ripe is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-european ip network.\n\nupdate – submitting information for entry into or removal from the ripe database.\n\ninternet number resource – globally unique address space (ipv4 and ipv6) and autonomous system numbers (asns) issued by any internet number registry.\n\nprimary objects – internet number resources and other data object types that are not directly related to any other primary object type and which are defined by routing policy specification language (rpsl) or which have been agreed by the ripe community as acceptable primary data.\n\nripe database – the publicly available data collection of internet number registry (inr) and internet routing registry (irr) data published by the ripe ncc. it contains all the primary and secondary objects. there is also some non-public data required for the operation of the ripe database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the ripe database.\n\nregistrant – a natural person or legal entity to whom an internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other primary object in the ripe database by specific or general agreement with the ripe ncc.\n\nmaintainer – any registrant or person to whom the authority to update has been delegated by a registrant, either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\nend user – a person for whom an internet number resource has been registered for their use.\n\ndata subject – a natural person whose personal contact details or other personal data are recorded in the ripe database.\n\ncontact details – all details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, e-mail or any other form of electronic communication that is used by a natural person or a legal entity.\n\npersonal contact details – contact details pertaining to a natural person.\n\ninternet registry – any registry that makes internet number resources available to other people and records information in a database about the registrant.\n\n\n# general\n\npersonal contact details are held in several object types (see appendix g) the person object is the starting point for all data sets in the ripe database and this procedure will focus on these objects.\n\nchanges to personal contact details can have significant consequences. to change or remove personal contact details may require:\n\n * references to be removed from other objects.\n * some other objects to be deleted.\n * internet number resources to be returned to the appropriate internet registry.\n * registrant/maintainer to lose control and/or right of usage of the internet number resource.\n\nthe precise course of action depends on the type of object in which the person object is referenced. the ripe ncc has a legal obligation to remove personal contact details on request from the data subject in some situations.\n\nif the data subject is the registrant of an internet number resource and wishes to remain the registrant of that resource, the following options are available:\n\n * insert personal contact details for some other person from the data subject’s organisation.\n * insert contact details related to the maintainer of the resource if this is not the data subject. this option is only available if the maintainer agrees or if the maintainer is also the registrant.\n * insert contact details related to the organisation responsible for the parent resource (provided that this is not the ripe ncc). in this case, responsibility for maintaining the data should also pass to this parent resource organisation if they are not already the maintainer. this option is only available if the parent resource organisation agrees.\n * deny the request to remove personal contact details if the data subject is the registrant and does not wish to return the internet number resource, or the data subject is the maintainer and does not wish to release control over the resource and none of the above options are available.\n\nthe data subject needs to be aware of the consequences of removing personal contact details where the options above are not possible or acceptable. the data subject cannot maintain an internet number resource and be anonymous. where accountability for registrations of global resources conflicts with an individual’s right to privacy, drastic action may be required. this may involve returning internet number resources to the internet registry that issued them and removing all associated data from the ripe database.\n\n\n# procedure\n\nthe ripe ncc has tried to clearly identify a series of steps that can be taken at different stages. the aim is to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all parties and protect everyone’s interests while maintaining the ripe ncc’s responsibility as a public registry of internet number resources. the ripe ncc will always inform the data subject within four weeks in writing whether a request for change or removal of personal contact details will be granted. if the request is denied, the ripe ncc will duly motivate this decision. this procedure refers only to person objects for clarity, but other objects may be involved (see appendix g).\n\nthe steps that will be taken are as follows:\n\n 1. the ripe ncc is contacted by a data subject asking for their personal contact details to be removed from the ripe database. the data subject must clearly identify the details they are referring to by sending a copy of the personal contact details to the ripe ncc.\n 2. the ripe ncc forwards the request to the maintainer of the person object and copies the data subject on the\n    e-mail. the maintainer is asked to resolve the issue within ten working days and send confirmation to both the ripe ncc and the data subject.\n 3. a. if the ripe ncc receives confirmation from the maintainer that action has been taken, the ripe ncc notifies both the maintainer and the data subject that the case is closed.\n    b. if no confirmation is received from the maintainer, but the person object has been deleted or substantially changed, the ripe ncc notifies both the maintainer and the data subject that the issue has been resolved and the case is closed.\n    c. if no confirmation is received from the maintainer, and nothing has changed, the ripe ncc contacts the data subject and copies the message to the maintainer. the data subject is asked to confirm that they still want the personal contact details removed. if they confirm this, the ripe ncc moves to step 4 (below).\n\nthe following steps are the actions the ripe ncc will take when the maintainer does not respond to or does not comply with the request to change or remove contact details:\n\n 4. the ripe ncc asks the data subject for a copy of a legal identification document. this document must match the personal contact details to be removed. this should be faxed to the ripe ncc together with a formal request for the removal of the personal contact details.\n 5. the ripe ncc receives the signed request and identification document from the data subject.\n 6. if it is a simple case where:\n    * the person object is unreferenced.\n    * each object referencing the person object references more than one person object.\n 7. for a simple case, the ripe ncc sends an acknowledgement to the data subject and the maintainer informing them that the personal contact details have been removed and the case is closed.\n\nfor anything other than one of the simple cases, the ripe ncc continues with the following steps:\n\n 8.  the ripe ncc sends a statement to the data subject of actions to be taken, which includes a list of any other data that may be affected which is directly related to the person object and the changes that need to be made to this data. this list will highlight any resources that will need to be returned to an internet registry or transferred to another maintainer and the possible consequences of this action. these consequences may include the removal of some data from the ripe database.\n\n 9.  because of the referential integrity rules, when any data is removed from the ripe database, there can be a chain reaction. this may result in more data being changed or removed. the maintainers of any such data will be informed and requested to make the appropriate changes. these changes will have to be made before the data subject's details can be removed because no object can be deleted from the ripe database while it is still referenced.\n\n 10. if there is an option for data to be transferred to another maintainer but the latter maintainer is not willing to be the maintainer of this data, then there are only two options available:\n     \n     * the user must return the resource to the appropriate internet registry and their personal contact details will be removed.\n     * the user’s personal contact details cannot be removed but can be corrected if there is an error.\n     \n     in the former case, if the data subject confirms the action, the ripe ncc moves into the clean-up phase. in the latter case, any corrections will be applied and the case is closed.\n\n 11. a. if the data subject confirms the action in the statement, the ripe ncc moves into the clean-up phase.\n     b. if the data subject does not confirm this action, no further action is possible and the case is closed.\n\n\n# clean-up phase\n\nthis is the procedure taken by the ripe ncc when the removal of personal contact details is not a simple case. the actual implementation is

The dummification is only applied to personal data. This environment makes it possible for you to test your software with upcoming versions of the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Information About Services\n\nSERVICE           LOCATION\ncommand line      whois-rc.ripe.net, port 43\nsyncupdates       https://syncupdates-rc.db.ripe.net\nREST API          https://rest-rc.db.ripe.net\nRDAP API          https://rdap-rc.db.ripe.net\nweb application   https://rc.db.ripe.net\nmailupdates       rc-dbm@ripe.net\n\n\n# Differences From Live RIPE Database\n\n * For each mntner object in the Release Candidate database, the passwords have been set to the object id. For example, the object:\n\ninetnum: 193.0.0.0 - 103.0.7.255 ... mnt-by: ninja-mnt ... can be changed by supplying the password: ninja-mnt. Regardless of the passwords used in the live RIPE Database, in the Release Candidate database they have been adjusted to reflect the mntner id.\n\n * The databases are snapshots of live RIPE Database data, dummified in the beginning of each new testing period. Personal data is replaced during the dummification process.\n * No emails are sent from the Release Candidate system. This means no response from mailupdates submissions to the Release Candidate database, no ack or notify emails are sent by the Release Candidate database.\n\n\n# Notes\n\nAs in the live RIPE Database, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are active. Even though the personal data in the Release Candidate database is dummified, ACLs are active to ensure it operates in the same way as the production system.\n\nEven though the Release Candidate database contains snapshot of the live data from the start of the testing period, no changes made to the Release Candidate database will have any impact on the live RIPE Database data. The two are completely separated.\n\nAny scripts or automated processes you use to maintain your data in the RIPE Database can be used with the Release Candidate database - simple adjust the URLs accordingly. The whole purpose is to allow you to test your processes as closely as possible to the action RIPE Database using newly developed and released software.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.100\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 8 April 2021 Production environment: 22 April 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.100 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Separate email address and leading/trailing space during Punycode conversion (#782)\n * Use status index during update validation (#725)\n * Fixed aut-num attribute managed flag in lookup and search response (#749)\n * Added client flag to API for proxying requests (#728)\n * RDAP nameserver not implemented (#711)\n * Fixed delete object bug (#723)\n * Java 11 support (#673)\n * Update dependencies\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.101\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 17 June 2021 Production environment: 1 July 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.101 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Switch RIPE database to UTC timezone\n * Display an error on NRTM if client is blocked by ACL limit (#812)\n * Added rewrite rules to embedded jetty (#801)\n * RDAP nameserver queries always return Not Implemented (#811)\n * Updated dependencies\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# Operational Changes\n\nSome operational changes will also de made to the production environment on 1 July 2021:\n\n * Remove support for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 on HTTPS connections\n   * The IETF has formally deprecated these TLS versions, now only version 1.2 and 1.3 are recommended.\n * Remove unsecure TLS cipher algorithms\n   * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SH\n * Remove HTTP redirects for whois.ripe.net and www.db.ripe.net\n   * HTTP requests to these hosts will no longer redirect to https://apps.db.ripe.net but will return 400 Bad Request.\n * Remove HTTP redirects for the legacy Whois REST API\n   * The legacy Whois REST API was retired in 2015, a temporary redirect is now being removed.\n   * HTTP requests to http://apps.db.ripe.net/whois/lookup/ripe will return 400 Bad Request.\n\nPlease check your Whois client in case you are affected by these changes.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 23 November 2021 Production environment: 7 December 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102 includes the following main changes:\n\n * NWI-13: Geofeed (#937)\n * Support base64 encoded signed update messages (sent by Thunderbird 78+)(#942)\n * Updated "geoloc:" help text (#929)\n * Support IDN in outgoing mail update notifications (#888)\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102.1\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 13 December 2021 Production environment: 13 December 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102.1 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Updated Log4j to 2.15.0 to fix the Log4Shell vulnerability: https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102.2\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 20 December 2021 Production environment: 20 December 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102.2 includes the following main change:\n\n * Update the Log4j library from 2.15.0 to 2.17.0 to fix vulnerabilities\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102.3\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 31 March 2022 Production environment: 31 March 2022\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102.3 includes the following main change:\n\n * Update of the Spring Framework library from 5.3.13 to 5.3.18 to address Spring4Shell vulnerability.\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.103\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 25 April 2022 Production environment: 9 May 2022\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.103 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Fixed "geofeed:" validation when reading object containing multiple remarks: attributes (#975)\n * Removed WHITEPAGES org type.

candidate database, no ack or notify emails are sent by the release candidate database.\n\n\n# notes\n\nas in the live ripe database, access control lists (acls) are active. even though the personal data in the release candidate database is dummified, acls are active to ensure it operates in the same way as the production system.\n\neven though the release candidate database contains snapshot of the live data from the start of the testing period, no changes made to the release candidate database will have any impact on the live ripe database data. the two are completely separated.\n\nany scripts or automated processes you use to maintain your data in the ripe database can be used with the release candidate database - simple adjust the urls accordingly. the whole purpose is to allow you to test your processes as closely as possible to the action ripe database using newly developed and released software.\n\n\n# ripe database release 1.100\n\n\n# date of deployment\n\nrelease

These are the maintainers of the data. The RIPE NCC supports the operation of the RIPE Database. The maintainers are primarily responsible for the data but the RIPE NCC also has some responsibility as a Database Controller. The responsibilities are explained in more detail in the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe data is accessible by Whois query (whois.ripe.net) and through a web interface, subject to the RIPE Database terms and conditions.\n\n\n# What is acceptable use of the RIPE Database?\n\nThe purpose and use of the RIPE Database is defined in the RIPE Database terms and conditions. The purpose of the RIPE Database is to assist the operation of the Internet in the RIPE region. Use of information from the RIPE Database for activities such as marketing, advertising and distributing Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) is covered by the Terms and Conditions.\n\n\n# What is a netname?\n\nA netname is a mandatory attribute of an inetnum object which contains a short but meaningful name of the IP allocation or assignment. Two or more inetnum objects can have the same netname. The netname attribute is a look-up key, one can query the RIPE Database supplying the netname as an argument. The result of the query will show all inetnum objects with that netname.\n\n\n# What is a nic-hdl?\n\nA "nic-handle" is a unique identifier that references RIPE Database objects containing contact details for a specific person or role. Other RIPE Database objects list contact details by their nic-handle. This is a more reliable identifier than an email address or a person\'s name (which may not be unique).\n\n\n# Can I use a nic-handle from another Regional Internet Registry Database in the RIPE Database?\n\nYes, but you must create a person/role object in the RIPE Database to ensure referential integrity. There is no existing distributed database of person/role objects (i.e. contact information). Please note that updating an object in one database does not mean the object will be updated in any other database.\n\n\n# What is a tech-c and what is an admin-c?\n\nAn "admin-c" (administrative contact) and "tech-c" (technical contact) are network contacts, required to be listed by their nic-handles in certain RIPE Database objects. This is done for operational correspondence such as Network troubleshooting. The admin-c must be physically located at the site of the network. The tech-c does not need to be physically located at the site of the network. You can have multiple admin-c, tech-c and zone-c attributes in an object, each of them referencing different person or role objects.\n\n\n# Why has my \'as-name:\' not been accepted?\n\nThe \'as-name:\' should be a short name associated with the Autonomous System (AS). We recommend that the name reflects the name of the organisation that will use the AS Number. The name should be made up of letters, digits, the character underscore "_", and the character hyphen "-"; the first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. The following words are reserved by RPSL, and they can not be used as names: any, as-any, rs-any, peers, and, or, not, atomic, from, to, at, action, accept, announce, except, refine, networks, into, inbound, outbound\n\nNames starting with certain prefixes are reserved for certain object types. Names starting with "as-" are reserved for as set names. Names starting with "rs-" are reserved for route set names. Names starting with "rtrs-" are reserved for router set names. Names starting with "fltr-" are reserved for filter set names. Names starting with "prng-" are reserved for peering set names. Names starting with "irt-" are reserved for irt names.\n\n\n# Can I register a domain name in the RIPE Database?\n\nNo, the RIPE NCC does not register domain names. A decision was made by the RIPE community to remove all forward domain names from the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# How do I register a PERSON or ROLE object in the RIPE Database?\n\nNew RIPE Database users should create a role and maintainer pair. If you already have a maintainer object, you can use webupdates to create a additional objects.\n\nPlease note that person objects registered in the RIPE Database should be referenced from other objects in the RIPE Database, either directly or through a role object. Unreferenced objects will be deleted after 90 days.\n\n\n# Someone has created a person object with my personal details in the RIPE Database. Why did they do this?\n\nSome Internet Service Providers (ISPs) put information about their customers in the RIPE Database. This is usually because you have signed an agreement with the ISP to obtain Internet services from them and given your consent to publish your personal details in the RIPE Database. If you are unhappy with this, please contact your ISP. If you cannot resolve this issue with your ISP, please contact the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# My information in the RIPE Database is not correct, can you please update my object(s)?\n\nThe RIPE Database Terms and Conditions detail who is responsible for maintaining data in the RIPE Database. We suggest you contact the maintainer of the data that is incorrect and ask them to change it. If it is personal data that is incorrect and you are not satisfied with the response from the maintainer, please contact the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# How do I delete an object from the RIPE Database?\n\nIf you query for your object in the RIPE Database web interface, you will see the option to update it in the top right corner.\n\nAfter logging in with your RIPE NCC Access account, you may be required to authenticate against the maintainer that protects the object if it is not yet associated with your account.\n\nYou will then get to the screen where you can modify the object. The "delete" button is in the bottom left corner.\n\nAfter selecting "Delete this object", you will be asked for an optional reason. Once you provide this, the object will be removed from the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# My update failed. Please explain why it failed.\n\nThere are many reasons why an update could fail. Usually, the failure reasons listed in the acknowledgement message you received are self-explanatory. The errors and warnings are contained in the "***ERROR:" and "***WARNING:" lines attached to the object which failed. Please read these lines carefully. Often the errors are simple syntax errors in the object. Check your object for typing mistakes.\n\nAnother common mistake is to query the RIPE Database for an object without using the -B query flag, then submit the returned object in an update. This results in submitting a filtered object, indicated by the line \'source: RIPE # Filtered\' in the query response.\n\nSometimes, your update fails with this error message: "***Error: Authorisation failed". This means that you haven\'t supplied the correct credentials to satisfy the authorisation needed for the maintainer that protects the object. The maintainer is notified of a failed attempt to update this object.\n\nPlease note that if you send several objects in one message and at least one of them fails, the subject of the acknowledgment message will start with "FAILED:". This does not mean that the whole update failed, only that some updates were unsuccessful. Please check the message carefully to see which objects were not updated.\n\n\n# I received a message with the subject "Notification of RIPE Database changes", but I didn\'t do anything and don\'t understand the message. What is it?\n\nThe message you received has been automatically sent to you from the RIPE Database software. The purpose of this notification is to inform you that some objects have been changed in the RIPE Database. You received the message because you were either listed in a "notify:" attribute of the object itself, or in a "mnt-nfy:" attribute of the mntner that protects the object.\n\nIf you did not create or update the object yourself, then someone else did this. The e-mail address from which the update came is usually mentioned in the notification message. Please contact that e-mail address for questions and clarifications about the update.\n\n\n# What are the authorisation rules for route object creation?\n\nRefer to protection of route object space.\n\n\n# Can I download the RIPE Database software?\n\nYes you can download the RIPE database Whois server software from GitHub.\n\n\n# Can I download the RIPE Database?\n\nWe produce daily snapshots which are available to the public. You can find these files at our FTP site or split by object type.\n\nThese daily snapshots exclude the person object type and other personal data is dummified. For data protection reasons, personal data is not available in bulk format.\n\nAnother way to "download" the RIPE Database is to become a Near-Real-Time Mirror (NRTM). This means that you run a copy of the database at your site that keeps up-to-date with the master server by regularly downloading the most recent updates. All personal data is excluded from the NRTM download and updates. For more information, refer to Access to NRTM.\n\n\n# I cannot find any information about a network in the RIPE Database. Can I look somewhere else?\n\nYes: try full text search.\n\n\n# How do I register reverse-delegations in the RIPE Database?\n\nTo register reverse-delegations in the RIPE Database, see Reverse Delegations.\n\n\n# I want to have an IP to country conversion table; can I get it?\n\nThe inetnum object represents IP address space in the RIPE Database; this object has a \'country\' attribute. However, you should not rely on this information to be 100% accurate.\n\nResource holders can also add a "geofeed:" attribute to associate IP addresses to geographic locales. Refer to RFC9092 for more information.\n\n\n# I want to peer with an Autonomous System (AS). How do I do this?\n\nOnce an AS number has been assigned to you, you are responsible for keeping it up to date. It is important that your aut-num object in the RIPE Database reflects reality. If you have new peers and/or stop peering with one or more Autonomous Systems, please update your aut-num object. You update this object in the same way as any other object in the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Can I enter several contacts in one RIPE Database object?\n\nYes. You can have multiple admin-c, tech-c and zone-c attributes in an object, each of them referencing different contact record, person or role objects.\n\n\n# How do I update an object in the RIPE Database?\n\nIf you query for your object in the RIPE Database web interface, you will see the option to update it in the top right corner.\n\nAfter logging in with your RIPE NCC Access account, you may be required to authenticate against the maintainer that protects the object if it is not yet associated with your account. You will then get to the screen where you can modify the object.\n\n\n# Where are the RIR Databases, and what do they contain?\n\nThere are five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Each maintains a database holding details of IP address registrations in their regions. The RIR databases are located at:\n\nAFRINIC (Africa) ARIN (North America, some Caribbean and North Atlantic Islands) APNIC (Asia Pacific region) LACNIC (Southern and Central America and some Caribbean Islands) RIPE NCC (Europe, the Middle East, parts of Central Asia)\n\n\n# Why did I receive an Error 201: Access Denied?\n\nThere are several cases when this might occur. Please see below for the one which applies to your situation:\n\n * You (or your application) performed too many queries that returned contact information (e.g. person or role objects) from the RIPE Database. There is a daily limit on the amount of personal data returned as described in the Acceptable Use Policy.\n * Even if you queried for other types of objects, the associated contact information is returned by default. To avoid this situation please use the -r flag to prevent any associated contact information from being returned.\n * You used a proxy server to access the RIPE Database (such as a third-party web query interface). In this case, it is likely that the proxy itself was denied access to the database. Please contact then administrators of the server you were using and discuss this situation with them. They may need to contact the RIPE Database administration ripe-dbm@ripe.net team to request further access.\n * If none of the above describes your situation, please contact the RIPE Database administration team ripe-dbm@ripe.net to discuss the problem further.\n\n\n# How do I generate glue record for a DOMAIN object?\n\nHere is an example:\n\ndomain: 8.8.8.e164.arpa\ndescr: Example domain for the reserved prefix +888\n[...]\nnserver: ns1.8.8.8.e164.arpa 192.0.2.1\nnserver: ns2.8.8.8.e164.arpa 192.0.2.129\nnserver: ns1.example.net\nnserver: ns2.example.net\n[...]\n\n\nIn this example, the first two "nserver:" attributes contain one glue IP address. THe last two "nserver:" attributes do not need glue, as they are in a different domain - example.net.\n\n\n# How will I know what to fix if the DOMAIN object update failed?\n\nThe responses from our server will include diagnostic messages. You can get further help by sending an email to ripe-dbm@ripe.net.\n\n\n# How long until an update appears in the DNS?\n\nIf you see a message saying that your update was successful, it will be visible in the DNS after around an hour.\n\n\n# Which TTL value is used?\n\nWe will use the default value for the e164.arpa zone. If you need a specific TTL (Time to Live) value, send an email to enum-request@ripe.net.',normalizedContent:'# faq\n\n\n# what is the ripe database?\n\nthe ripe database contains information

When creating an object, one can also specify an "AUTO" NIC handle by setting the value of the attribute to "AUTO-1" or AUTO-1 <initials>. In these cases, the database software will assign the NIC handle automatically.\n\nnotify: <e-mail>\nSpecifies the email address to which notifications of changes to this object should be sent.\n\nnserver: <domain-name> [ <ipv4-address> | <ipv6-address> ]\nSpecifies the name servers of the domain, optionally followed by a glue record.\n\norg: <org-id>\n\nThis optional attribute may be used in any object type. It references an existing organisation object. For some resource objects, it is a required attribute. In these cases, the referenced organisation object represents the entity that holds the resource. In other objects, it can be used to specify a business relationship. The value of this attribute is the ID of the organisation object. It is required in the inetnum and inet6num objects with the following status values:\n\n * ALLOCATED-BY-RIR\n * ALLOCATED PA\n * ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\n * ALLOCATED PI\n * ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\n\nThe "org:" attribute is single-valued in the inetnum, inet6num and aut-num objects, and it is multi-valued in all other objects.\n\norg-name: <organisation-name>\n\nSpecifies the name of the organisation that this organisation object represents in the RIPE Database. This is an ASCII-only text attribute. This restriction is because the attribute is a look-up key and the RIPE Database protocol does not allow specifying character sets in queries. The user can put the name of the organisation using Latin 1 character set in the "descr:" attribute if required. But any use of non-ASCII characters in any object may cause problems during the update process.\n\norg-type:\n\nSpecifies the type of the organisation. The possible values are shown in the section \'Description of the ORGANIZATION Object\'\'.\n\norganisation: <org-id>\n\nSpecifies the ID of an organisation object. When creating this object, the value of this attribute is automatically generated. The user has to specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value to "AUTO-1" or "AUTO-1<letterCombination>, so that the database will assign the ID automatically.\n\norigin: <as-number>\nSpecifies the AS Number that originates the route. The corresponding aut-num object should exist in the database.\n\nowner: <generated>\nSpecifies the owner of the public key. Please refer to RFC 2726 for a detailed description of this attribute.\n\n           \npeer:      <protocol><ipv4-address><options>\n           <protocol><inet-rtr-name><options>\n           <protocol><rtr-set-name><options>\n           <protocol><peering-set-name><options>\n\nMay appear in an inet-rtr object. Specifies a protocol peering with another router. Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\npeering: <peering>\nDefines a peering that can be used for importing or exporting routes. Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\npeering-set: <object-name>\nSpecifies the name of the peering-set.

Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\nphone: <telephone-number>\nSpecifies a telephone number of the contact.\n\npoem: POEM <string>\nSpecifies the title of a poem.\n\npoetic-form: FORM <string>\nSpecifies the poem type.\n\nref-nfy: <e-mail>\nSpecifies the email address, as defined in RFC 2822, to be notified when a reference to the organisation object is added or removed.\n\nremarks: <freeform>\nContains remarks.\n\nrole: <role-name>\nSpecifies the full name of a role entity, e.g. RIPE DBM.\n\nrole-name: <role-name>\n\nSpecifies the name of the role in the RIPE Database. This is an ASCII-only text attribute. This restriction is because the attribute is a look-up key and the RIPE Database protocol does not allow specifying character sets in queries. Any use of non-ASCII characters in any object may cause problems during the update process.\n\nroute: <address-prefix>\nSpecifies the prefix of the interAS route. Together with the "origin:" attribute, it constitutes a primary key of the route object.\n\nroute6: <ipv6-address>/<prefix-length>\nSpecifies an IPv6 prefix. The <prefix length> is an integer in the range from 0 to 128. This is the prefix of the interAS route. Together with the "origin:" attribute, it constitutes a primary key of the route6 object.\n\nroute-set: <object-name>\nSpecifies the name of the route set. It is a primary key for the route-set object. Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\nrtr-set: <object-name>\nDefines the name of the rtr-set. Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\nsignature: PGPKEY-<id>\nReferences a key-cert object representing a CSIRT public key used by the team to sign their correspondence. <id> is the key-id of the PGP public key in eight-digit hexadecimal format without "0x" prefix.\n\nsource: <registry-name>\nSpecifies the registry where the object is registered. This should be "RIPE" for the RIPE Database.\n\nstatus: <status>\nSpecifies the status of the address range represented by an inetnum or inet6num object or the status of an AS Number represented by an aut-num object. For the possible values, see the sections \'Description of the INETNUM Object\', \'Description of the INET6NUM Object\' and \'Description of the AUT-NUM Object\'.\n\nPlease refer to the RIPE Document ripe-622, "IPv4 Address Allocation and Assignment Policies in the RIPE NCC Service Region", for further information.\n\ntech-c: <nic-handle>\nReferences a technical contact.\n\ntext: <freeform>\nContains text of the poem.

Database\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe RIPE NCC has a test database where users may learn how to use the software. This database uses the same software as the RIPE Database, but is completely separate. You cannot change anything in the RIPE Database by changing an object in the TEST database.\n\nThe data in the TEST database is not a copy of the data in the RIPE Database. Also, it is not authoritative data. No value should be put on the data in the TEST database. The database is reset to a default state each night.\n\nYou can create objects in the TEST database to simulate a part of your real network. You can then experiment with different situations in this TEST environment safely.\n\n\n# Creating Objects in the TEST Database\n\nThere are different ways to create objects in the TEST database\n\n                \nWeb interface   For creating a single object using a form. Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/#/webupdates/select\n                To get started, create a role and maintainer pair. Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/TEST/role/self\nMailupdates     Email you object to test-dbm@ripe.net. You will receive an\n                acknowledgement message with the result.\nSyncupdates     For creating one or more objects at a time, using a single\n                field to edit objects. Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates You can\n                also submit updates from the command line (or script) via:\n                https://syncupdates-test.db.ripe.net/\nREST API        Software API to create a single object at a time. Documented\n                in whois rest api. The base URL for the TEST environment is\n                https://rest-test.db.ripe.net/test\n\n\n# Finding Objects in the TEST Database\n\nThere are different ways to find objects in the TEST database\n\n                \nWeb interface   Go to https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query\nCommand line    Do\n                whois -h whois-test.ripe.net <Search String>\n                e.g.\n                whois -h whois-test.ripe.net PB3-RIPE\n                The query flags that work in the RIPE Database also work in\n                the TEST Database. We invite you to try them.\nREST API        Software API to search Whois or lookup a single object.\n                Documented in whois rest api\n\n\n# MNTNER Objects in the TEST Database\n\nYou can create your own mntner objects in the TEST database. This mntner object only maintains objects in the TEST database.\n\nThese are different ways to create a mntner object in the TEST database.\n\n                \nWeb interface   To create a single object (choose mntner from the dropdown):\n                (a) Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/select\n                (b) Choose mntner from the dropdown and click Create\n                (c) Complete the form and click Submit\nREST API        Software API to create, update or delete a single object.\n                Documented in whois rest api\nMailupdates     (a) complete (fill in) a mntner object template\n                (b) email the completed template to test-dbm@ripe.net.\n                (c) You will receive an email reply with the result.\n\nThere are some RIPE NCC maintainers in the TEST database which can be used for authentication.\n\n                  \nTEST-DBM-MNT      Maintainer for TEST DBM objects. The maintainer password is\n                  "emptypassword" without the quotes.\nTEST-NCC-HM-MNT   Hostmaster maintainer. The maintainer password is\n                  "emptypassword" without the quotes.\n\n\n# Creating INETNUM Allocations in the TEST Database\n\nFor this example, use the web interface to create an inetnum.\n\nIf you did not create your own mntner object, please use TEST-NCC-HM-MNT as the mntner of the inetnum.\n\nAfter typing in the inetnum field value, you will be prompted to choose a mntner to authenticate the update operation. Choose TEST-DBM-MNT and deselect the checkmark that says "Also authorise my RIPE NCC Access account for this maintainer".\n\nFor example, create an inetnum with a /21 prefix in the 2/8 range.\n\nThe “org:” (organisation) attribute is required for an inetnum object with the status ‘ALLOCATED PA’ or ‘ALLOCATED PI’. The mntner password for the organisation "mnt-ref:" attribute must be known in order to make a reference to the organisation. The organisation object must have an "org-type:" attribute with the value ‘LIR’ for the \'ALLOCATED PA\' status (for example, use ORG-EIPB1-TEST as an LIR and authenticate with the TEST-DBM-MNT password).\n\n\n# Creating AUT-NUM Objects in the TEST Database\n\nAut-num objects in the RIPE database are only assigned by the RIPE NCC. However, you are free to create aut-num objects in the TEST database.\n\nYou can create an aut-num object from create an Object page.\n\nYou can also create an aut-num object using the Syncupdates.\n\nYou need to authenticate with the TEST-DBM-MNT password, which maintains the root as-block object.\n\n\n# Creating Route Objects\n\nFor this example, use the web interface to create a pair role and maintainer.\n\nYou need to create an LIR organisation as well. Normally LIR organisations are created by the RIPE NCC for a member. Only an LIR organisation can be referenced from an allocation. Use your newly created role (e.g TR1-TEST) as the admin-c and tech-c. Use your newly created mntner (e.g. TESTMNT-MNT) as the mnt-by.\n\nYou can also create the organisation using the Syncupdates. e.g.:\n\norganisation:    AUTO-1\norg-name:        Test Organisation\norg-type:        LIR\naddress:        Amsterdam\ne-mail:         eshryane@ripe.net\nadmin-c:         TR1-TEST\ntech-c:          TR1-TEST\nmnt-ref:         TESTMNT-MNT\nmnt-by:          TEST-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT\nsource:          TEST\npassword: emptypassword\n\n\nAfter creating the organisation you need to create an allocation. Normally the allocations are created by the RIPE NCC for a member organisation. You need some address space before creating a route object. Use your new organisation (e.g. ORG-TO2-TEST) as your "org:" reference\n\nYou can also create the allocation using the Syncupdates. e.g.:\n\ninetnum:         11.0.0.0 - 11.0.0.255\nnetname:         NL-TEST\ncountry:         NL\norg:               ORG-TO2-TEST\nadmin-c:         TR1-TEST\ntech-c:          TR1-TEST\nstatus:          ALLOCATED PA\nmnt-by:     TEST-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT\nsource:          TEST\npassword: emptypassword\n\n\nFinally, you can create the route object in the address space that you have just allocated.\n\nYou can also create the route object using the Syncupdates. e.g.:\n\nroute:           11.0.0.0/24\norigin:          AS3333\ndescr:           route\nmnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT\nsource:          TEST\n',normalizedContent:'# appendix j-

RIPE database. They are associated with a user’s RIPE NCC Access account, and are intended to help users script (automate) updates to the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nAPI keys are a way to authenticate updates in the RIPE Database. They are associated with a user’s RIPE NCC Access account, and are intended to help you script (automate) updates to the RIPE Database. If you only make updates using the web interface, then you don’t need API keys!\n\nTo start using API keys, go to the Web query page, login to RIPE NCC Access, and go to the API keys page on the left-hand menu. https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/api-keys\n\n\n# Create a New Database Key\n\nOn the API keys page, click on “Create a new Database key”.\n\n * Enter a key name (required) : a short description of how the key will be used.\n * Enter an expiration date (required) : when does the API key stop working. Keys are time-limited for security reasons and are valid up to a year in the future.\n * Enter a maintainer (optional) : if you have added your RIPE NCC Access account to more than one maintainer, you can restrict the API key to only work with one specified maintainer.\n\nThen click on "Create a key".\n\nWhen the key is created you\'ll see a popup.\n\nThe API key is composed of two parts. You can either use it combined in a single HTTP Authorization header, or separately as a username and password using your HTTP client.\n\nMake sure to copy down either the combined header value or the username and password. The password will only be shown to you once. The username will be used subsequently as the key id.\n\n\n# List Database Keys\n\nAfter closing the popup, the new key appears in a list, including:\n\n * Name (the text you entered describing the key)\n * Key ID (the generated username part of the key)\n * Last Used (the last time the key was used to successfully authenticate an update)\n * Expiration date (the date on which the key expires and can no longer be used)\n * Details (any other attributes such as the maintainer if entered)\n\n\n# Authenticated Queries using an API Key\n\nTo authenticate using an API key, you must first associate your RIPE NCC Access account with a maintainer using an auth: SSO attribute. Then you can authenticate queries and updates as your RIPE NCC account using the newly created API key.\n\nYou need to authenticate a database query if you want to update a maintainer, so you can read the entire object including auth: attributes unfiltered. The entire mntner object is returned, including all auth: attributes and no "Filtered" comment.\n\nFor example:\n\n$ curl -v --header "Accept: application/xml" \\\n --header "Authorization: Basic NkhEVORLSFFETVBHVUE5VFpJQjVSRFVCOlc2R2FFdDJTa1Ry\nRk84eGgyRXFGVTRQaА==" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/mntner/shryane-mnt?unfiltered\n\n\n\n# Authenticated Updates using an API Key\n\nWe will now update a person object that is used as a "tech-c:" attribute by the maintainer.\n\nFirst query for the unfiltered person object. You don’t need to authenticate this step.\n\n$ curl -o output https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/ES7554-RIPE?unfiltered\n\n\nThen edit the "output" file and make a change to the person object.\n\nThen make the update in the database.\n\nFor example:\n\n$ curl -v \\\n  --header "Authorization: Basic NkhEVORLSFFETVBHVUE5VFpJQjVSRFVCOlc2R2FFdDJTa1Ry\nRk84eGgyRXFGVTRQaА==" \\\n -X PUT -d @output \\\n --header "Content-type: application/xml" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/ES7554-RIPE\n\n\nThe person object is updated successfully if the response is 200 OK.\n\n\n# Revoking an API Key\n\nIf you suspect that an API key has been compromised - e.g. if anyone else could know what it is - then it’s safest to revoke the key and create a new one.\n\nTo do this, find the API key on the page and click on the “Revoke” button.\n\nAs soon as you revoke a key it cannot be used to authenticate queries or updates in the RIPE database.',normalizedContent:'# appendix k- api

including all auth: attributes and no "filtered" comment.\n\nfor example:\n\n$ curl -v --header "accept: application/xml" \\\n --header "authorization: basic nkhevorlsffetvbhvue5vfpjqjvsrfvcolc2r2ffddjta1ry\nrk84eggyrxfgvtrqaа==" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/mntner/shryane-mnt?unfiltered\n\n\n\n# authenticated updates using an api key\n\nwe will now update a person object that is used as a "tech-c:" attribute by the maintainer.\n\nfirst query for the unfiltered person object. you don’t need to authenticate this step.\n\n$ curl -o output https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/es7554-ripe?unfiltered\n\n\nthen edit the "output" file and make a change to the person object.\n\nthen make the update in the database.\n\nfor example:\n\n$ curl -v \\\n  --header "authorization: basic nkhevorlsffetvbhvue5vfpjqjvsrfvcolc2r2ffddjta1ry\nrk84eggyrxfgvtrqaа==" \\\n -x put -d @output \\\n --header "content-type: application/xml" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/es7554-ripe\n\n\nthe person object is updated successfully if the response is 200 ok.\n\n\n# revoking an api key\n\nif you suspect that an api key has been compromised - e.g. if anyone else could know what it is - then it’s safest to revoke the key and create a new one.\n\nto do this, find the api key on the page and click on the “revoke” button.\n\nas soon as you revoke a key it cannot be used to authenticate queries or updates in the ripe database.',charsets:{cyrillic:!0},lastUpdated:"2025-01-30T10:30:31Z",lastUpdatedTimestamp:1738233031e3},{title:"Glossary",frontmatter:{permalink:"/Glossary"},regularPath:"/24.Glossary.html",relativePath:"24.Glossary.md",key:"v-9181ffda",path:"/Glossary/",headers:[{level:3,title:"Attribute

extra lines are continuation lines.\n\n\n# Autonomous System (AS)\n\nA group of IP networks that have a single and clearly defined external routing policy, operated by one or more network operators.\n\n\n# Autonomous System (AS) Number\n\nA unique, numeric value given to an AS. The range of numbers starts at 0 and extends up to a maximum value held by a 32-bit unsigned number 4,294,967,295.\n\n\n# Canonical\n\nStandard or typical. For Ipv6 and DNS, it represents a standard textual representation format.\n\n\n# Child Object\n\nThis object is one level down (more specific) in a hierarchy of INETNUM or INET6NUM objects\n\n\n# Child objects are more specific\n\nBoth IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are structured in hierarchies with 0/0 and ::/0 as the roots of the structures. The root objects have child objects forming the next layer in the hierarchical structure. The root objects are therefore the parents of the child objects. This is repeated throughout the structure as more layers are added. Parent objects are considered to be less specific than the child objects. Child objects are considered to be more specific to the parent objects.\n\n\n# Contact Details\n\nAll details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, email or any other form of electronica communication that is used by a person or an organisation.\n\n\n# Data Contained Therein\n\nA legal phrase referring to information stored in the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Data Controller\n\nA person or organisation that determines the purpose and the manner in which personal data is processed.\n\n\n# Dictionary Attacks\n\nIn computer security, this is a technique for breaking an authorisation mechanism by trying to determine a password, passphrase or an encryption key by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary.\n\n\n# Domain Name\n\nA unique name that identifies an Internet location such as a website.\n\n\n# Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)\n\nThe Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for security certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It is a set of extensions to DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.\n\n\n# Dummification\n\nA process that removes personally identifiable information from the RIPE Database output.\n\n\n# Dummified\n\nWhen all personally identifiable information has been removed from the data.\n\n\n# ENUM\n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocol that maps E.164 telephone numbers to Internet services using the DNS.\n\n\n# Global Resource Service (GRS)\n\nThe RIPE NCC operated mirrors of the others RIR's databases as well as some of the major routing registries. Only operational data is stored based on the published statistics of authoritative resources from each RIR. The RIPE Whois service allows this set of mirrors to be queried as a single logical database and returns authoritative responses from the appropriate source.\n\n\n# Glue Record\n\nThe IP address of a name server held at the Domain Name registry. Glue records are required when you wish to set the name servers of a domain name to a hostname under the domain name itself.\n\n\n# Heuristic\n\nUsing experience-based techniques for problem-solving.\n\n\n# Hierarchical Address Space\n\nIndividual IP addresses are 'flat' addresses. Each address is unique but it does not say anything about where the address is relative to any other address. They are usually allocated and assigned as ranges of addresses. Further sub allocations and assignments can be made from allocations. This builds an administrative hierarchy within the address space, even though the address space itself is not hierarchical.\n\n\n# IANA\n\nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority.\n\n\n# in-addr.arpa\n\nA special domain name used to achieve reverse delegation for IPv4 addresses.\n\n\n# INET(6)NUM\n\nA common abbreviation meaning both INETNUM and INET6NUM objects.\n\n\n# Internet Number Registry (INR)\n\nA registry that allocated Internet number resources and holds and publishes details of Internet number resource information.\n\n\n# Internet Number Resources\n\nGlobally unique address space (IPv4 and IPv6) and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) issued by any Internet Number Registry.\n\n\n# Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)\n\nIPv4 uses 32-bit (four-byte) addresses, which gives a total pool of 4,294,967,296 (2^32) addresses. These addresses are normally represented in a dotted quad notation. An example of an IPv4 address is: 192.0.2.35.\n\n\n# Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)\n\nIPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which gives a total pool of 2^128 addresses. These addresses are normally represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. An example of an IPv6 address is:2001:db8:cd0f:421d:2209:bc:80ba:2095.\n\n\n# Internet Routing Registry (IRR)\n\nA registry that holds and publishes details of Internet routing information.\n\n\n# IP Address\n\nA unique numerical address used to identify a particular piece of hardware connected to the Internet. An IP address services two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.\n\n\n# ip6.arpa\n\nA special domain name used to achieve reverse delegation for IPv6 addresses.\n\n\n# Latin-1\n\nA character set defined by ISO8859-1.\n\n\n# Legacy Resource\n\nInternet number resources that we distributed before (or outside of) the current system of hierarchical distribution by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).\n\n\n# Less Specific\n\nBoth IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are structured in hierarchies with 0/0 and ::/0 as the roots of the structures. The root objects have child objects forming the next layer in the hierarchical structure. The root objects are therefore the parents of the child objects. This is repeated throughout the structure as more layers are added. Parent objects are considered to be less specific than the child objects. Child objects are considered to be more specific to the parent objects.\n\n\n# Maintainer\n\nAny Registrant or person to whom the authority to Update has been delegated by a Registrant either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\n\n# MD5 Password Hash\n\nMD5 is an algorithm for converting a password or passphrase into a hash of characters.\n\n\n# Nested\n\nA series of objects are nested when one references the next, that references the next, and so on.\n\n\n# Network Information Centre (NIC) handle\n\nA sequence of characters that form a unique identifying string used to identify contacts in the RIPE Database (people and business roles).\n\n\n# Object Template\n\nA pattern or guide describing the characteristics of a specific object type.\n\n\n# Object Type\n\nThere are many different RIPE Database objects representing different pieces of information. They are grouped by type, for example a person object type holds contact information for a person.\n\n\n# Overlap\n\nOne address range crosses the boundary of another address range. For example: inetnum: 10.240.89.60 - 10.240.89.67 inetnum: 10.240.89.64 - 10.240.89.79\n\n\n# Parent Object\n\nThis object is one level up (less specific) in a hierarchy of INETNUM or INET6NUM objects.\n\n\n# Parse / Parsing\n\nAnalyse (a string or text) into logical syntactic components, typically in order to test conformance to a logical grammar.\n\n\n# Personally Identifiable Information\n\nA legal phrase that means information that can be used to identify a person.\n\n\n# Prefix\n\nIP address prefixes are patterns which match the first n binary bits of an IP address where n is the prefix.\n\n\n# Prefix Notification\n\nSpecifies ranges using two parts: the starting address and its length (or prefix).\n\n\n# Primary Key\n\nA unique identifier in the RIPE Database within a set of objects of the same type.\n\n\n# Primary Objects\n\nThe set of objects that contain all the operational data in the RIPE Database. All other (secondary) objects are there to support the primary objects.\n\n\n# Pseudo-attribute\n\nAn attribute added to an object, or an update message, that is not part of the RPSL object structure. It is needed for the management of the object(s) in the update message. For example supplying a password for an update using the \"password:\" pseudo attribute.\n\n\n# Query the RIPE Database\n\nTo request information from the RIPE Database\n\n\n# Range Notation\n\nSpecifies ranges using two parts: the starting address and the end address separated by a hyphen and space characters ('-')\n\n\n# Registrant\n\nA natural person or legal entity to whom an Internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other primary object in the RIPE Database by specific or general agreement with the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# Required attribute\n\nThe syntax rules define this attribute as optional. However, additional business rules require this attribute to be present under some circumstances.\n\n\n# Resource Holder\n\nA person or organisation to which an Internet resource has been registered.\n\n\n# Reverse Delegation\n\nAllows mapping to a domain name from an IP address.\n\n\n# RIPE Community\n\nRIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide are IP networks in Europe and beyond. The objective of RIPE is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-European IP network.\n\n\n# RIPE Database\n\nThe publicly available data collection of Internet Number Registry (INR) data, Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data and Reverse Delegation data published by the RIPE NCC. It contains all the primary and secondary objects. There is also some non-public data required for the operation of the RIPE Database and the registries. Its full title is the RIPE Network Management Database. Or sometime it is referred to as the RIPE Whois Database. But for simplicity it is mostly referred to as the RIPE Database. These names are interchangeable and all mean the same thing.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Attribute\n\nThe key name for a formatted element of data in a RIPE Database object. The format may be well defined or free format. An attribute must always have a value associated with it. Unless it is free format, the value cannot be blank. Attributes are sometimes referred to as keys.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Object\n\nA record in the RIPE Database containing information about an Internet resource or some supporting or administrative details.\n\n\n# RIPE Internet Number Registry (RIPE INR)\n\nA registry managed by the RIPE NCC that allocated Internet number resources and holds and publishes details of RIPE resources.\n\n\n# RIPE Internet Routing Registry (RIPE IRR)\n\nA registry managed by the RIPE NCC that holds and publishes details of Internet routing information.\n\n\n# RIPE NCC Service Region\n\nThis defines the geographical area in which the RIPE NCC provides services as an RIR. This includes Europe, the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.\n\n\n# RIPE Policy Development Process (PDP)\n\nThe RIPE community develops and sets policies through a long-established, open, bottom-up process of discussion and consensus-based decision-making.\n\n\n# ROUTE(6)\n\nA common abbreviation meaning both ROUTE and ROUTE6 objects\n\n\n# Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)\n\nAllows a network operator to be able to specify routing policies at various levels in the Internet hierarchy.\n\n\n# Routing Policy System Security (RPSS)\n\nThe Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is used for purposes that have a strong requirements for data integrity and security. The Routing Policy System Security addresses issues of data integrity and security consistent with the usage of the IRR and which avoids compromising data integrity and security.\n\n\n# Secondary Objects\n\nA set of objects that exist in the RIPE Database to support the primary objects.\n\n\n# Uniform Resource identifier (URI)\n\nThe generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the World Wide Web.

A User who Accesses the RIPE Database agrees to these Terms and Conditions.\n 3. Only Registrants and the RIPE NCC have the authority to Update the RIPE Database. To Update the RIPE Database, a Registrant has to take on the role of a Maintainer or authorise a third party to act as Maintainer on his behalf.\n 4. A Registrant who accepts a registration of an Internet number resource from the RIPE NCC, or who registers any other Primary object in the RIPE Database, or who copies a registration of an Internet number resource from another registry into the RIPE Database, must accept these Terms and Conditions before assuming a Registrant's authority to Update the RIPE Database, even if that authority is then delegated to a Maintainer.\n 5. A Maintainer who is not a Registrant must accept these Terms and Conditions before accepting the delegated authority from a Registrant to Update the RIPE Database.\n 6. A Maintainer may only Update the RIPE Database with these types of data:\n    * Internet number resources for which the Registrant holds a valid registration\n    * Primary objects that are not Internet number resources, for which the Registrant has agreement to register\n    * Secondary objects related to either of the above\n 7. A Secondary object must be related to an existing or intended valid Primary object at the time of the Update to create the Secondary object in the RIPE Database. At any time this relationship becomes no longer valid, or the intended relation is never completed, the Secondary object must be deleted. It may be subject to automatic deletion by the RIPE Database management software at any time if it is invalid.\n 8. Registrants and Maintainers will assist the RIPE NCC with security checks and audits as appropriate.\n\n\n# Article 3 - Purpose of the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE Database contains information for the following purposes:\n\n * Ensuring the uniqueness of Internet number resource usage through registration of information related to the resources and Registrants\n * Publishing routing policies by network operators (IRR)\n * Facilitating coordination between network operators (network problem resolution, outage notification etc.)\n * Facilitating network operations by publishing geolocation information about the usage of Internet number resources (including country, region, city of the party to which the resources have been distributed by the Registrants)\n * Provisioning of Reverse Domain Name System (DNS) and ENUM delegations\n * Providing information about the Registrant and Maintainer of Internet number resources when the resources are suspected of being used for unlawful activities, to parties who are authorised under the law to receive such information.\n * Scientific research into network operations and topology\n * Providing information to parties involved in disputes over Internet number resource registrations to parties who are authorised under the law to receive such information.\n\n\n# Article 4 - Use of the RIPE Database\n\n 1.

If the RIPE NCC believes Users are acting in a coordinated way to bypass the above limits, we will consider the situation and act on a case-by-case basis. References\n\n\n# References\n\n[1] Where no limits are set, or a limit is set as Unlimited, we work on the basis of reasonable use. This means that we expect Users not to do anything that could abuse or damage the RIPE Database service or cause service disruption for other Users. If we detect any User causing problems we may, at our sole discretion, slow down or temporarily or permanently block Access to the RIPE Database services for that User.\n\n[2] Queries can be sent to the RIPE Database without the need to wait for the previous query to return.\n\n[3] If the number of personal data sets limit is exceeded, the User will be temporarily blocked from making any queries to the RIPE Database from the IP address, or SSO Account, submitting the queries for personal data. The number of queries accepted from the temporarily blocked IP address or SSO Account will recover exponentially over time. This will allow a slower query rate for some time. However, if a User is temporarily blocked several times, or continues to submit queries excessively even while blocked, they will be permanently blocked from querying the RIPE Database from that IP address or SSO Account, as the case may be. Despite the set limits for queries by the RIPE Database User, the email contacts which are included in the ”abuse-c” attribute are meant to be available with no restrictions to bulk access.

featured in the sidebar to the left. You can switch between these sections and items at any time by clicking on the links.\n\nYou can also use the searchbar above to search for any word or phrase on any page.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Appendix K- API Keys\n\nAPI keys are a way to authenticate updates in the RIPE database. They are associated with a user’s RIPE NCC Access account, and are intended to help users script (automate) updates to the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nAPI keys are a way to authenticate updates in the RIPE Database. They are associated with a user’s RIPE NCC Access account, and are intended to help you script (automate) updates to the RIPE Database. If you only make updates using the web interface, then you don’t need API keys!\n\nTo start using API keys, go to the Web query page, login to RIPE NCC Access, and go to the API keys page on the left-hand menu. https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/api-keys\n\n\n# Create a New Database Key\n\nOn the API keys page, click on “Create a new Database key”.\n\n * Enter a key name (required) : a short description of how the key will be used.\n * Enter an expiration date (required) : when does the API key stop working. Keys are time-limited for security reasons and are valid up to a year in the future.\n * Enter a maintainer (optional) : if you have added your RIPE NCC Access account to more than one maintainer, you can restrict the API key to only work with one specified maintainer.\n\nThen click on "Create a key".\n\nWhen the key is created you\'ll see a popup.\n\nThe API key is composed of two parts. You can either use it combined in a single HTTP Authorization header, or separately as a username and password using your HTTP client.\n\nMake sure to copy down either the combined header value or the username and password. The password will only be shown to you once. The username will be used subsequently as the key id.\n\n\n# List Database Keys\n\nAfter closing the popup, the new key appears in a list, including:\n\n * Name (the text you entered describing the key)\n * Key ID (the generated username part of the key)\n * Last Used (the last time the key was used to successfully authenticate an update)\n * Expiration date (the date on which the key expires and can no longer be used)\n * Details (any other attributes such as the maintainer if entered)\n\n\n# Authenticated Queries using an API Key\n\nTo authenticate using an API key, you must first associate your RIPE NCC Access account with a maintainer using an auth: SSO attribute. Then you can authenticate queries and updates as your RIPE NCC account using the newly created API key.\n\nYou need to authenticate a database query if you want to update a maintainer, so you can read the entire object including auth: attributes unfiltered. The entire mntner object is returned, including all auth: attributes and no "Filtered" comment.\n\nFor example:\n\n$ curl -v --header "Accept: application/xml" \\\n --header "Authorization: Basic NkhEVORLSFFETVBHVUE5VFpJQjVSRFVCOlc2R2FFdDJTa1Ry\nRk84eGgyRXFGVTRQaА==" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/mntner/shryane-mnt?unfiltered\n\n\n\n# Authenticated Updates using an API Key\n\nWe will now update a person object that is used as a "tech-c:" attribute by the maintainer.\n\nFirst query for the unfiltered person object. You don’t need to authenticate this step.\n\n$ curl -o output https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/ES7554-RIPE?unfiltered\n\n\nThen edit the "output" file and make a change to the person object.\n\nThen make the update in the database.\n\nFor example:\n\n$ curl -v \\\n  --header "Authorization: Basic NkhEVORLSFFETVBHVUE5VFpJQjVSRFVCOlc2R2FFdDJTa1Ry\nRk84eGgyRXFGVTRQaА==" \\\n -X PUT -d @output \\\n --header "Content-type: application/xml" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/ES7554-RIPE\n\n\nThe person object is updated successfully if the response is 200 OK.\n\n\n# Revoking an API Key\n\nIf you suspect that an API key has been compromised - e.g. if anyone else could know what it is - then it’s safest to revoke the key and create a new one.\n\nTo do this, find the API key on the page and click on the “Revoke” button.\n\nAs soon as you revoke a key it cannot be used to authenticate queries or updates in the RIPE database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Access to Personal Data\n\nFor privacy and data protection reasons, there is a limit to how much personal data a user can query from the RIPE Database over a period of time. For more details of the legal background, see the RIPE NCC Data Protection Report.\n\nPersonal information is contained in the person object. There may also be some personal information in some role objects. The access control mechanism built into the database software therefore applies to both person and role objects.\n\nThe access control mechanism used is based on the number of these objects that are returned in the results of any queries made. Limits are applied to the IP address of a user sending queries to the database server by any of the query methods. (See \'How to Query the RIPE Database\' for more details of the methods.)\n\nSometimes an IP address may be acting as a proxy and submitting queries on behalf of other IP addresses (for example, a webserver providing an interface to the RIPE Database). The database software provides a facility for proxy operators, which allows accounting to be based on the IP address of the End Users using the proxy to query the RIPE Database, and not on the IP address of the proxy operator. This is done using the -V flag as follows:\n\n-V &lt;version&gt;,&lt;ip-address&gt;\n\n\n * <version> is a client tag that can be any text string chosen by the proxy operator. Operators often use a string, showing the version of the software that the proxy operator uses, or, sometimes, they use an identifying string for the proxy operator.\n * <ip-address> is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the End User that queries the database using the proxy service\n\nNot all users can operate a proxy service and use this -V flag. You must contact RIPE Database Administration\n[ripe-dbm _at_ ripe _dot_ net] and explain why you need this facility. If your request is approved, the IP address of the proxy server will be added to an access control list. The proxy operator can then use the -V flag, but only from the IP address stated in the request.\nAttempting to use the -V flag without approval, or from any IP address not on the access control list, may result in permanent denial of access to the RIPE Database. This denial of access will apply to the IP address that submits the query using the -V flag.\n\n\n# Blocking Access to the RIPE Database\n\nEach time a person or role object is returned as part of a query result, a counter increases. When it reaches the limit defined in the AUP, the query execution is aborted and the connection is terminated, displaying an error message to the client (see the section on Access errors in the RIPE Database Query Server Response Codes and Messages). There is also a separate counter, tracking the number of times your request is denied. Retrieving any other object type does not affect these counters.\n\nAny role object used for abuse contacts with an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute is an exception to this rule. No accounting is done on these objects.\n\nWe restrict access to the RIPE Database to stop people from using it to collect excessive amounts of contact data. If the number of personal contact objects returned by all your queries in a day (defined by UTC) from one IP address exceeds the limits defined in the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), that IP address\'s access will be blocked. If your access is blocked, you will unable to query the RIPE Database for any object types - you are not just blocked from accessing contact data objects. This temporary block will be automatically released at midnight (UTC) to allow querying to continue. There is also a limit on the number of times an IP address can be blocked and recover. When this limit is reached, that IP address is permanently blocked from accessing the RIPE Database. This permanent block will not be removed automatically.\n\nThere are many reasons why you could find yourself blocked from querying the RIPE Database. One is that you are mining the RIPE Database for contact data to use for non-agreed purposes. In this case, the denial of access is justified and your IP address will remain on the blocked list. However, there may be other reasons why your IP address has been blocked. Queries for object types other than person and role objects return contact information by default. Using the -r or --no-referenced query flag to prevent contact data being included in your query results turns off this default. Alternatively, you may have an error in a script that runs automatically, retrieving contact data that you did not know about.\n\nIf you believe there was a genuine error or mistake that led to a permanent block, you should contact the RIPE Database administrators, explaining the error and what steps you have taken to stop it happening again. The RIPE Database administrators will decide if the block will be removed. It will remain on record that this IP address has been permanently blocked and then unblocked. If another permanent block occurs, it is less likely to be removed again.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Appendix A- Syntax of Object Attributes\n\nThe syntax definitions of the object attributes that the RIPE Database supports are shown below.\n\nThe value of an attribute has a type. Some of the most commonly used and complex types are shown in the table below. Others are explained in the descriptions of the attributes.\n\nCommonly Used Attribute Types\n\n                         \nType                     Description\n<quad>                   <xdigit>.){1,4}\n<dlabel>                 Domain name label as specified in RFC 1034.

Please see RPSLng RFC 4012 for more information.\n\nnetname: <netname>\nSpecifies the name of a range of IP address space. The syntax of the <netname> attribute is the same as the syntax of the <object-name> attribute, but it does not have a restriction on RPSL-reserved prefixes.\n\nnic-hdl: <nic-handle>\nSpecifies the NIC handle of a role or person object. When creating an object, one can also specify an "AUTO" NIC handle by setting the value of the attribute to "AUTO-1" or AUTO-1 <initials>. In these cases, the database software will assign the NIC handle automatically.\n\nnotify: <e-mail>\nSpecifies the email address to which notifications of changes to this object should be sent.\n\nnserver: <domain-name> [ <ipv4-address> | <ipv6-address> ]\nSpecifies the name servers of the domain, optionally followed by a glue record.\n\norg: <org-id>\n\nThis optional attribute may be used in any object type. It references an existing organisation object. For some resource objects, it is a required attribute. In these cases, the referenced organisation object represents the entity that holds the resource. In other objects, it can be used to specify a business relationship. The value of this attribute is the ID of the organisation object. It is required in the inetnum and inet6num objects with the following status values:\n\n * ALLOCATED-BY-RIR\n * ALLOCATED PA\n * ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\n * ALLOCATED PI\n * ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\n\nThe "org:" attribute is single-valued in the inetnum, inet6num and aut-num objects, and it is multi-valued in all other objects.\n\norg-name: <organisation-name>\n\nSpecifies the name of the organisation that this organisation object represents in the RIPE Database. This is an ASCII-only text attribute. This restriction is because the attribute is a look-up key and the RIPE Database protocol does not allow specifying character sets in queries. The user can put the name of the organisation using Latin 1 character set in the "descr:" attribute if required. But any use of non-ASCII characters in any object may cause problems during the update process.\n\norg-type:\n\nSpecifies the type of the organisation. The possible values are shown in the section \'Description of the ORGANIZATION Object\'\'.\n\norganisation: <org-id>\n\nSpecifies the ID of an organisation object. When creating this object, the value of this attribute is automatically generated. The user has to specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value to "AUTO-1" or "AUTO-1<letterCombination>, so that the database will assign the ID automatically.\n\norigin: <as-number>\nSpecifies the AS Number that originates the route. The corresponding aut-num object should exist in the database.\n\nowner: <generated>\nSpecifies the owner of the public key. Please refer to RFC 2726 for a detailed description of this attribute.\n\n           \npeer:      <protocol><ipv4-address><options>\n           <protocol><inet-rtr-name><options>\n           <protocol><rtr-set-name><options>\n           <protocol><peering-set-name><options>\n\nMay appear in an inet-rtr object.

Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\nphone: <telephone-number>\nSpecifies a telephone number of the contact.\n\npoem: POEM <string>\nSpecifies the title of a poem.\n\npoetic-form: FORM <string>\nSpecifies the poem type.\n\nref-nfy: <e-mail>\nSpecifies the email address, as defined in RFC 2822, to be notified when a reference to the organisation object is added or removed.\n\nremarks: <freeform>\nContains remarks.\n\nrole: <role-name>\nSpecifies the full name of a role entity, e.g. RIPE DBM.\n\nrole-name: <role-name>\n\nSpecifies the name of the role in the RIPE Database. This is an ASCII-only text attribute. This restriction is because the attribute is a look-up key and the RIPE Database protocol does not allow specifying character sets in queries. Any use of non-ASCII characters in any object may cause problems during the update process.\n\nroute: <address-prefix>\nSpecifies the prefix of the interAS route. Together with the "origin:" attribute, it constitutes a primary key of the route object.\n\nroute6: <ipv6-address>/<prefix-length>\nSpecifies an IPv6 prefix. The <prefix length> is an integer in the range from 0 to 128. This is the prefix of the interAS route. Together with the "origin:" attribute, it constitutes a primary key of the route6 object.\n\nroute-set: <object-name>\nSpecifies the name of the route set. It is a primary key for the route-set object. Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\nrtr-set: <object-name>\nDefines the name of the rtr-set. Please refer to RPSL RFC 2622 for more information.\n\nsignature: PGPKEY-<id>\nReferences a key-cert object representing a CSIRT public key used by the team to sign their correspondence. <id> is the key-id of the PGP public key in eight-digit hexadecimal format without "0x" prefix.\n\nsource: <registry-name>\nSpecifies the registry where the object is registered. This should be "RIPE" for the RIPE Database.\n\nstatus: <status>\nSpecifies the status of the address range represented by an inetnum or inet6num object or the status of an AS Number represented by an aut-num object. For the possible values, see the sections \'Description of the INETNUM Object\', \'Description of the INET6NUM Object\' and \'Description of the AUT-NUM Object\'.\n\nPlease refer to the RIPE Document ripe-622, "IPv4 Address Allocation and Assignment Policies in the RIPE NCC Service Region", for further information.\n\ntech-c: <nic-handle>\nReferences a technical contact.\n\ntext: <freeform>\nContains text of the poem.

If the TLD is not responsive, the TLD should remove its data from the RIPE Database.\n\nReverse domain\nThese objects should be deleted and removed from the DNS system.\n\ninet(6)num\nThe address space must be returned to the appropriate Internet Registry and then the object can be deleted.\n\nThe RIPE NCC will take no action until the Data Subject has cancelled any routing arrangements for the address space to be returned and any related route(6) objects have been deleted.\n\naut-num\nThese objects should be deleted.\n\nThe RIPE NCC will take no action until the Data Subject has cancelled any routing arrangements where this AS number is the origin and any related route(6) objects have been deleted.\n\nrole\nIf the role object only references this one person object, find all the references to the role object and consider them as if they were direct references to the person object.\n\nmntner\nFind all objects that reference this mntner object and carry out the following actions on each of these objects:\n\n * Where there are references to more than one mntner object in the same attribute type, remove the reference to this mntner object.\n * If it is referenced in an optional attribute, remove the attribute.\n * Where an object references only this mntner object in a single instance of a mandatory attribute, consider this object as if it had a single reference to the person object to be deleted. This object may also need to be deleted and then follow the chain of references to this object and handle all referencing objects according to this list.\n\nWhen all references to the mntner object have been removed, delete the mntner object.\n\nkey-cert\nReferences to person objects are optional, so remove any reference to this person object from the key-cert object.\n\nirt\nRemove references to this irt object from inet(6)num objects, then delete the irt object.\n\norganisation\nReferences to person objects are optional, so remove any reference to this person object from the organisation object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Appendix G- Object Types with Personal Data\n\nPersonal Contact Details are only held in these object types:\n\n * person\n * role\n * organisation\n * irt\n\nRole object references can be replaced by one or more of the person objects it references.\n\nOrganisation object references are optional everywhere except in inetnum objects with a status of ALLOCATED. References to organisation objects can simply be removed from anywhere else.\n\nIrt object references are all optional. These references can also simply be removed.\n\nIn all cases, the role, organisation and irt object can then be deleted when there are no references to it.\n\nPerson objects are discussed in detail in this procedure.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Appendix H- PGP Authentication Method\n\nIn this section, we provide an example of the PGP authentication method. For this example we will start from the beginning, supposing that there is no a previous mntner object created.\n\n * Create the first mntner and role object.\n * Install gpg or a similar tool. In this example, gpg will be used. brew install gpg\n * Run the next command to create public and private key gpg --gen-key. The output of this command should contain the next piece of text:\n   \n   pub   ed25519 2024-05-03 [SC] [expires: 2027-05-03]\n   6A9DFE0F2C9239EF07CADA4A4BD32D1CF9C96367\n   \n\n * Before creating the key-cert object gpg --export --armor 6A9DFE0F2C9239EF07CADA4A4BD32D1CF9C96367 need to be executed. This command will export the public key in plain text.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nComment: GPGTools - http://gpgtools.org\n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\nos2DfBlmAP9VdqYSQAdqzoQcUWS8j+AIkmmGe/wzKRg3lVEjX6CMBg==\n=XknZ\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- \n\n\n * Now is time to create the key-cert object.

This database uses the same software as the RIPE Database, but is completely separate. You cannot change anything in the RIPE Database by changing an object in the TEST database.\n\nThe data in the TEST database is not a copy of the data in the RIPE Database. Also, it is not authoritative data. No value should be put on the data in the TEST database. The database is reset to a default state each night.\n\nYou can create objects in the TEST database to simulate a part of your real network. You can then experiment with different situations in this TEST environment safely.\n\n\n# Creating Objects in the TEST Database\n\nThere are different ways to create objects in the TEST database\n\n                \nWeb interface   For creating a single object using a form. Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/#/webupdates/select\n                To get started, create a role and maintainer pair. Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/TEST/role/self\nMailupdates     Email you object to test-dbm@ripe.net. You will receive an\n                acknowledgement message with the result.\nSyncupdates     For creating one or more objects at a time, using a single\n                field to edit objects. Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates You can\n                also submit updates from the command line (or script) via:\n                https://syncupdates-test.db.ripe.net/\nREST API        Software API to create a single object at a time. Documented\n                in whois rest api. The base URL for the TEST environment is\n                https://rest-test.db.ripe.net/test\n\n\n# Finding Objects in the TEST Database\n\nThere are different ways to find objects in the TEST database\n\n                \nWeb interface   Go to https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query\nCommand line    Do\n                whois -h whois-test.ripe.net <Search String>\n                e.g.\n                whois -h whois-test.ripe.net PB3-RIPE\n                The query flags that work in the RIPE Database also work in\n                the TEST Database. We invite you to try them.\nREST API        Software API to search Whois or lookup a single object.\n                Documented in whois rest api\n\n\n# MNTNER Objects in the TEST Database\n\nYou can create your own mntner objects in the TEST database. This mntner object only maintains objects in the TEST database.\n\nThese are different ways to create a mntner object in the TEST database.\n\n                \nWeb interface   To create a single object (choose mntner from the dropdown):\n                (a) Go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/select\n                (b) Choose mntner from the dropdown and click Create\n                (c) Complete the form and click Submit\nREST API        Software API to create, update or delete a single object.\n                Documented in whois rest api\nMailupdates     (a) complete (fill in) a mntner object template\n                (b) email the completed template to test-dbm@ripe.net.\n                (c) You will receive an email reply with the result.\n\nThere are some RIPE NCC maintainers in the TEST database which can be used for authentication.\n\n                  \nTEST-DBM-MNT      Maintainer for TEST DBM objects. The maintainer password is\n                  "emptypassword" without the quotes.\nTEST-NCC-HM-MNT   Hostmaster maintainer. The maintainer password is\n                  "emptypassword" without the quotes.\n\n\n# Creating INETNUM Allocations in the TEST Database\n\nFor this example, use the web interface to create an inetnum.\n\nIf you did not create your own mntner object, please use TEST-NCC-HM-MNT as the mntner of the inetnum.\n\nAfter typing in the inetnum field value, you will be prompted to choose a mntner to authenticate the update operation. Choose TEST-DBM-MNT and deselect the checkmark that says "Also authorise my RIPE NCC Access account for this maintainer".\n\nFor example, create an inetnum with a /21 prefix in the 2/8 range.\n\nThe “org:” (organisation) attribute is required for an inetnum object with the status ‘ALLOCATED PA’ or ‘ALLOCATED PI’. The mntner password for the organisation "mnt-ref:" attribute must be known in order to make a reference to the organisation. The organisation object must have an "org-type:" attribute with the value ‘LIR’ for the \'ALLOCATED PA\' status (for example, use ORG-EIPB1-TEST as an LIR and authenticate with the TEST-DBM-MNT password).\n\n\n# Creating AUT-NUM Objects in the TEST Database\n\nAut-num objects in the RIPE database are only assigned by the RIPE NCC. However, you are free to create aut-num objects in the TEST database.\n\nYou can create an aut-num object from create an Object page.\n\nYou can also create an aut-num object using the Syncupdates.\n\nYou need to authenticate with the TEST-DBM-MNT password, which maintains the root as-block object.\n\n\n# Creating Route Objects\n\nFor this example, use the web interface to create a pair role and maintainer.\n\nYou need to create an LIR organisation as well. Normally LIR organisations are created by the RIPE NCC for a member. Only an LIR organisation can be referenced from an allocation. Use your newly created role (e.g TR1-TEST) as the admin-c and tech-c. Use your newly created mntner (e.g. TESTMNT-MNT) as the mnt-by.\n\nYou can also create the organisation using the Syncupdates. e.g.:\n\norganisation:    AUTO-1\norg-name:        Test Organisation\norg-type:        LIR\naddress:        Amsterdam\ne-mail:         eshryane@ripe.net\nadmin-c:         TR1-TEST\ntech-c:          TR1-TEST\nmnt-ref:         TESTMNT-MNT\nmnt-by:          TEST-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT\nsource:          TEST\npassword: emptypassword\n\n\nAfter creating the organisation you need to create an allocation. Normally the allocations are created by the RIPE NCC for a member organisation. You need some address space before creating a route object. Use your new organisation (e.g. ORG-TO2-TEST) as your "org:" reference\n\nYou can also create the allocation using the Syncupdates. e.g.:\n\ninetnum:         11.0.0.0 - 11.0.0.255\nnetname:         NL-TEST\ncountry:         NL\norg:               ORG-TO2-TEST\nadmin-c:         TR1-TEST\ntech-c:          TR1-TEST\nstatus:          ALLOCATED PA\nmnt-by:     TEST-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT\nsource:          TEST\npassword: emptypassword\n\n\nFinally, you can create the route object in the address space that you have just allocated.\n\nYou can also create the route object using the Syncupdates. e.g.:\n\nroute:           11.0.0.0/24\norigin:          AS3333\ndescr:           route\nmnt-by:          TESTMNT-MNT\nsource:          TEST\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Authorisation\n\nAuthorisation in the RIPE Database is based on the Routing Policy System Security (RPSS) that is explained in more detail in RFC 2725.\n\n * Authorisation - The power or right to make decisions and have access. This can be delegated.\n * Authentication - To ensure that the entity making use of the authorisation is what or who it claims to be.\n * Credential - Something that shows an entity has a right to exercise authorisation, providing the basis for confidence.\n\nThese three words are often confused. When talking about the RIPE Database, an authenticated person may be granted or given a credential by a system administrator or official contact, authorising this person to access and manage objects in the database.\n\nDifferent types of objects in the database require different levels of protection. The server supports multiple authorisation methods. Because of the data model used by the RIPE Database, it is not always possible to identify who is making an update. The mntner objects only hold credentials – for example, encrypted password hashes or references to cryptographic keys. There is no connection between many of these credentials and any identifiable person.\n\nIn order to make the password tokens a more secure form of protection, the encrypted hashes are hidden from public view. A query on a mntner object will have any password hashes removed in the query result. These hashes can only be seen if you can supply the clear text password as part of the query. The only way to do this via the Webupdates form.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Authorisation Model\n\nThe mntner objects serve as anonymous containers that hold authorisation credentials. A reference to a mntner object within any object defines authorisation necessary to perform operations on that object or on a set of related objects. Such reference is provided by means of several attributes including "mnt-by:", "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:", "mnt-domains:", "mnt-ref:" and "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nThe mntner object contains one or more mandatory "auth:" attributes. Each attribute begins with a keyword identifying the authorisation method followed by the authorisation information or token needed to enforce that method. The irt object also has mandatory "auth:" attributes used for authorisation.\n\nAll updates require authorisation. A credential that is valid for one of the authorisation tokens of one of the relevant mntner objects, must be supplied. Different methods of authorisation require different authorisation tokens, as shown in the table below of authorisation methods that are currently supported.\n\nVisit this section to know more about mntner object.\n\nAUTHORISATION METHOD   DESCRIPTION\nMD5-PW                 This scheme is based on the MD5 hash algorithm. The\n                       authorisation information stored in the database is a\n                       passphrase, encrypted using md5-crypt algorithm, which is a\n                       concatenation of the "$1$" string, the salt, and the 128-bit\n                       hash output. Because it uses an eight-character salt, a\n                       passphrase of almost unlimited length and the encrypted hash\n                       is hidden from public view, this scheme is quite stable\n                       against dictionary attacks.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: MD5-PW $1$abcd4321$HyM/GVhPqXkkIMVerxxQ3z\nPGPKEY                 This is a strong form of authorisation. The authorisation\n                       information is a signature identity pointing to a public key\n                       certificate, which is stored in a separate key-cert object.\n                       The update is authorised if the transaction is signed by the\n                       corresponding private key. The RIPE NCC does not guarantee\n                       that a key belongs to any specific entity. Anyone can supply\n                       any public keys, with any ownership information, to the RIPE\n                       Database. These keys can be used to protect other objects by\n                       checking that the update comes from a user who knows the\n                       corresponding secret key. The database software only allows\n                       current keys (that have not expired) to sign an update\n                       message, and signed messages are only valid for one hour.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: PGPKEY-1380K9U1\nSSO                    This scheme is based on the RIPE NCC Access single sign-on\n                       (SSO) system. It takes the management of these authorisation\n                       tokens outside of the RIPE Database. The authorisation\n                       tokens are managed by the RIPE NCC Access software. To use\n                       this, you must first create an account with RIPE NCC Access.\n                       \n                       The SSO system was introduced so that when somebody signs in\n                       once with RIPE NCC Access, that account authorises them to\n                       use certain services that support it, such as Webupdates or\n                       the Syncupdates web form.\n                       \n                       The credential in the mntner object uses the keyword SSO\n                       followed by the email address used to sign in to your SSO\n                       account. You can add many different SSO credentials to a\n                       mntner object and add your SSO credential to as many mntner\n                       objects as you wish (provided you have authority to update\n                       each mntner object using existing authorisation). If you\n                       change your email address in your RIPE NCC Access\n                       preferences, this will immediately be reflected in any\n                       mntner objects where this access account is referenced.\n                       \n                       authorisation using SSO can be done from Webupdates and the\n                       Syncupdates web form. You can sign into your RIPE NCC Access\n                       account directly from Webupdates and Syncupdates. Using any\n                       of the update features from Webupdates/Syncupdates you can\n                       create, modify and delete objects. No password is needed -\n                       you are already authenticated and authorised to make these\n                       updates, assuming the object(s) are maintained by one of\n                       your SSO mntner objects.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: SSO dbtest _at_ ripe _dot_ net\nX.509                  This is similar to PGP. You ned a certificate and a private\n                       key. The certificate must be included in a key-cert object.\n                       The update is authorised if the transaction is signed by the\n                       corresponding X.509 private key. The RIPE NCC does not\n                       guarantee that a certificate belongs to any specific entity.\n                       Anyone can supply any certificate, with any ownership\n                       information, to the RIPE Database. Those certificates can be\n                       used to protect other objects by checking that the update\n                       comes froma user who knows the corresponding private key.\n                       The database software only allows current keys (that have\n                       not expired) to sign an update message, and signed messages\n                       are only valid for one hour.\n                       \n                       Example:\n                       \n                       auth: X509-3333\n\n\n# Solving Authentication Problems\n\nGiven the flexibility of the RIPE Database and the maintainer system, there can be cases where you find yourself unable to authenticate. Currently, only certain combinations of authentication and update methods are compatible, as shown in this table:\n\n                             SSO   PGP   MD5\nWebupdates (Web interface)   Yes   No    Yes*\nEmail                        No    Yes   Yes*\nAPI                          No    No    Yes\nSyncupdates                  No    Yes   Yes*\n\n*It works, but is not recommended\n\nWe recommend that if you predominantly use the web interface, you only use the SSO, and if you mainly use syncupdates or email updates, you use PGP.\n\nDepending on your use case, it is important to carefully consider which authentication method you put on each maintainer you manage. For example, there are three basic situations where authentication might fail when trying to use the web interface:\n\n * The object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer that is not yours. You therefore rightfully do not have access.\n * The object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer with several SSO account, none of which are yours. The maintainer also doesn\'t have a shared MD5 password that would allow you to authenticate.\n * The object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer that only has a PGP key as the authorisation.\n\nFor cases 1 and 2, you need to ask the administrative or technical contact of the maintainer to give you the appropriate access. For case 2, you can use another update method that does support your authentication, such as email.\n\nLastly, in case your maintainer is protected with a MD5 password that you forgot, you can reset it here.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Force Delete Functionality\n\nForce delete allows you to delete inet(6)num, route(6) and domain objects by using the maintainer of a covering address space object, instead of the maintainer of the object itself. This means the "mnt-lower:" of an allocation or the "mnt-by:" of a provider independent (PI) or anycast assignment or legacy under contract, each have the authority to force delete any more specific or related object.\n\nIn some cases it can occur that objects in the RIPE Database that fall under your address space have a maintainer that you do not control. For example, when you give joint control over an object to another user by using their "mnt-by:", you and the other party now have equal permissions. Now they have the ability to remove your maintainer from the object and take complete control. Another common issue is where an existing route object blocks the creation of a new exact matching route object.\n\nForce delete allows you to remove these objects even though you do not have the credentials for the maintainer on them. Instead, you can use the maintainer of the covering address space object, i.e. the "mnt-lower:" of the allocation or the "mnt-by:" of the PI or anycast assignment or legacy under contract.\n\nThere are very strict rules about which objects can be force deleted and whose authorisation is allowed to override the object\'s authorisation. Also keep in mind that it is only possible to delete objects: modifying them is not possible.\n\n\n# Authorisation to Force Delete\n\nNormally an object can only be deleted if the operation is authorised by one of the mntner objects in the "mnt-by:" attributes of the object to be deleted. With force delete, the RIPE Database also looks for the exact match, encompassing, or less specific address space object that was allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThe result is that in addition to the "mnt-by:" attribute of the object itself, the "mnt-lower:" of an allocation or the "mnt-by:" of a PI or anycast assignment or legacy under contract, each have the authority to force delete any more specific or related primary object.\n\n\n# Example of Force Delete\n\nThe force delete functionality only applies to holders of resources that are issued directly by the RIPE NCC. In the example below, the mntner object LIR-MNT can authorise the deletion of any of the objects shown, except for the allocation object itself. The holder of a sub-allocation does not have the authority to delete an assignment from that sub-allocation. So in this example, SUB-MNT cannot be used to delete the ASSIGNED PA block.\n\nThe same applies to the route and domain object in this example. Even though they fall under the sub-allocation, SUB-MNT cannot be used. Only LIR-MNT can force delete these objects.\n\nALLOCATED PA  \ninetnum: 10.128.0.0 - 10.128.255.255  \nmnt-by: RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT  \nmnt-lower: LIR-MNT  \nmnt-routes: LIR-RT-MNT  \n\nSUB-ALLOCATED PA  \ninetnum: 10.128.0.0 - 10.128.127.255  \nmnt-by: SUB-MNT  \nmnt-lower: SUB-MNT  \n\nroute: 10.128.0.0 - 10.128.127.255  \norigin: AS3333  \nmnt-by: AS3333-MNT  \n\nASSIGNED PA  \ninetnum: 10.128.1.0 - 10.128.1.255  \nmnt-by: END-MNT  \n\ndomain: 1.128.10.in-addr.arpa  \nmnt-by: END-MNT\n\n\n\n# Objects that can be Force Deleted\n\nNot all object types can be force deleted by a resource holder. Only the following primary object types are covered by this functionality:\n\n * inetnum\n * inet6num\n * route\n * route6\n * domain\n\nFor inetnum and inet6num object types, all objects more specific to an allocation made by the RIPE NCC are included, regardless of their status. The parent allocation object itself is not included as it is managed by the RIPE NCC. Objects related to PI assignments are included but, again, the PI assignments themselves are not included as they are assigned by the RIPE NCC. Therefore, a resource holder cannot accidentally delete their own resource object.\n\nFor route and route6 object types, any route(6) objects with a prefix exactly matching or more specific to any resource allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC are included. Multiple route(6) objects with the same prefix, and different origins, are all included.\n\nReverse delegation domain objects, ending with ip6.arpa or in-addr.arpa, with a prefix exactly matching or more specific to any resource allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC, are included. ENUM domain objects are not included.\n\nAutonomous System Number objects are not included. These aut-num objects are resources assigned by the RIPE NCC and so can only be deleted by the RIPE NCC.\n\nNo secondary objects (for example person and role) are included, even if they are directly referenced by any of the primary objects listed above and so would be unreferenced after deleting the primary object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# IRT Object\n\nIRT: Incident Response Team - handles security incidents and/or cases of abuse of omputer networks or its components.\n\nTI: Trusted Introducer - this service is a trustbroker for IRTs. More information\n\n\n# How to Create an IRT Object\n\n\n# Manual creation\n\n# Requirements\n\nIf you are an IRT and want to create an irt object in the RIPE Database, you need to following:\n\n * A maintainer for that object. This should be a mntner object in the RIPE Database\n * A key-cert object in the RIPE Database containing a public PGP key\n * An IP address (range) for which you are responsible as an IRT. This should be in the form of an inet(6)num object in the RIPE Database.\n * Any other information that is mandatory for an irt object\n\n# The Maintainer (MNTNER object)\n\nA maintainer of an object in the RIPE Database is an entity, which can alone make changes to that object. A mntner object represents the maintainer. The maintainer authenticates change request either by using a PGP-Key, password or SSO account as specified in "auth:" attribute.\n\nIf you as a team are responsible for a range of IP addresses, there almost certainly will be an inet(6)num object in the database. The maintainer of this object can also maintain your irt object.\n\nThe RIPE NCC will not create a mntner object just for maintenance of an irt object.\n\n# The PGP Key and the KEY-CERT Object\n\nA PGP key for secure email communication is mandatory for an IRT to create an irt object. Before creating one, you will have to create a key-cert object matching your PGP key in the RIPE Database.\n\nYou can create one by sending a completed template by email to auto-dbm@ripe.net\n\nHere is an example:\n\nkey-cert:     PGPKEY-6DFC4771\nmethod:       PGP\nowner:        DFN-CERT (2003), ENCRYPTION Key \nfingerpr:     E8 A7 18 F7 DF 3D 19 64  8D 26 C4 CC BF 2F 0C C4\ncertif:       -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\ncertif:       Version: PGP Key Server 0.9.5\ncertif:\ncertif:       mQENAz3SIaUAAAEIAKze7wWJ9BDa3iDcQpxZ9+YSVxq+j1prWPsnINMm8GyTMU2H\n\n[...]\n\ncertif:       epPs4s0AnjV6ncb6BrbHiU+zeVY8tcW1bopeAJ0VuW0D/+3joueFiL7fDGSV6KPu\ncertif:       Uw==\ncertif:       =DKvl\ncertif:       -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nmnt-by:       TRUSTED-INTRODUCER-MNT\nnotify:       tiirt@stelvio.nl\nnotify:       dfncert@cert.dfn.de\nsource:       RIPE\n\n\nAs you can see, you also need a mntner for the key-cert object.\n\nThese are the fields of a key-cert object:\n\nkey-cert:       [mandatory]   [single]     [primary/lookup key]\nmethod:         [generated]   [single]     [ ]\nowner:          [generated]   [multiple]   [ ]\nfingerpr:       [generated]   [single]     [inverse key]\ncertif:         [mandatory]   [multiple]   [ ]\norg:            [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\nremarks:        [optional]    [multiple]   [ ]\nnotify:         [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\nadmin-c:        [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\ntech-c:         [optional]    [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-by:         [mandatory]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\ncreated:        [generated]   [single]     [ ]\nlast-modified:  [generated]   [single]     [ ]\nsource:         [mandatory]   [single]     [ ]\n\n\nYou can use the text above as a template.\n\n# The Creation Process\n\nYou start the process of creating an irt object by sending a completed template by e-mail to the RIPE NCC. As creation of an irt object is a manual process, you should address your email to ripe-dbm@ripe.net\n\nIn your mail, you need to explain why you want to create a new irt object. To prevent misuse of the object, the RIPE NCC will need to check your request, so include a full explanation. A good idea is the listing of the inet(6)num objects you, as an IRT, are responsible for and from which you want to link to from your new irt object.\n\nYou will get a reply from the RIPE NCC asking you to acknowledge your request.\n\n\n# Creation Through the Trusted Introducer (TI) Service\n\nYou need to become a TI accredited team. The TI will register and maintain your IRT object.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nThis is the body of an example e-mail with which the TI creates object for a newly accredited team:\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nirt:        IRT-TCERT\naddress:    Telia AB, HQ\naddress:    TeliaCERT\naddress:    SE-123 86 Farsta\naddress:    Sweden\nphone:      +46 8 713 1872\nfax-no:     +46 706 175 101\ne-mail:     tcert@telia.se\nsignature:  PGPKEY-D47485CF\nencryption: PGPKEY-D47485CF\nadmin-c:    TI123-RIPE\ntech-c:     TI123-RIPE\nauth:       PGPKEY-D47485CF\nremarks:    Emergency telephone number +46 8 713 1872 (GMT+1/GMT+2 with DST)\nremarks:    http://www.trusted-introducer.org/teams/tcert.html\nremarks:    This is an accredited IRT (level 2)\nirt-nfy:    tcert@telia.se\nnotify:     tiirt@s-cure.nl\nnotify:     tcert@telia.se\nmnt-by:     TRUSTED-INTRODUCER-MNT\nsource:     RIPE\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.1 (MingW32) - WinPT 0.5.13\n\niD8DBQE/O1yZHxjOrs1gxBcRAn5TAJ9lBL4op6txrM17m1SF1pIIjptTTgCcCt4n\nP0fRecfQHzFxhvASPKfTt1Q=\n=Q9fl\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n\n# How to Link INET(6)NUM Objects to an IRT Object\n\n\n# Requirements\n\nTo link an inet(6)num object to an irt object you need:\n\n * The authorisation of the team the irt object belongs to\n * The authorisation of the maintainer of the inet(6)num object\n\nAuthorisation can be provided by a PGP signature, password or SSO account. All possibilities are represented by the "auth:" field in the irt object.\n\n\n# Link a Single INET(6)NUM Object to an IRT Object\n\nThis is done by sending an email to auto-dbm@ripe.net. You provide the inet(6)num object with the necessary changes. In most cases you just need to add a "mnt-irt:" attribute.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nAn inet(6)num object as you find it in the RIPE Database before the change:\n\ninetnum:        193.174.13.0 - 193.174.13.255\nnetname:        DFNCERT-NET\ndescr:          DFN-CERT  Zentrum fuer sichere Netzdienste GmbH\ncountry:        DE\nadmin-c:        KM4692-RIPE\ntech-c:         KM4692-RIPE\nstatus:         ASSIGNED PA\nmnt-by:         DFN-LIR-MNT\ncreated:        2022-08-14T11:48:28Z\nlast-modified:  2022-10-25T12:22:39Z \nsource:         RIPE\n\n\nAnd this is the same object linked to an irt object:\n\ninetnum:        193.174.13.0 - 193.174.13.255\nnetname:        DFNCERT-NET\ndescr:          DFN-CERT  Zentrum fuer sichere Netzdienste GmbH\ncountry:        DE\nadmin-c:        KM4692-RIPE\ntech-c:         KM4692-RIPE\nstatus:         ASSIGNED PA\nmnt-by:         DFN-LIR-MNT\nmnt-irt:        IRT-DFN-CERT\ncreated:        2022-08-14T11:48:28Z\nlast-modified:  2022-10-25T12:22:39Z \nsource:         RIPE\n\n\nNow both the team and the maintainer of the inet(6)num object have to authorise the link request.\n\n# If Both Parties Use (different) PGP Keys for Authorisation\n\nBoth need to sign the request -mail. It does not matter in which order this signing occurs as long as both parties sign the request.\n\n# If Only One Party Uses a password or SSO for Authorisation\n\nIn this case, whoever is using PGP should initially sign the request and send it to the other. They forward it to the RIPE NCC, together with their password. This maintains password confidentiality. It is strongly recommended that anyone using passwords, switch to PGP authentication. It is a more secure way to handle requests made to the RIPE NCC.\n\nIf using SSO for authentication, then login to RIPE NCC access and send the request using Syncupdate.\n\n# If Both Parties Use Password or SSO Authorisation\n\nIn this case, at least one, if not both parties should consider switching to PGP authentication.\n\n# If the IRT Object and INET(6)NUM Object are Maintained by the Same Maintainer\n\nIn this case, the process is straightforward.\n\n\n# Step-by-Step Guide\n\nHow to link a single inet(6)num object to a single irt object.\n\nExact the inet(6)num object from the RIPE Database:\n\nwhois -h whois.ripe.net -r <ipadress> > inetnum.txt\n\n\nAlternatively you can search for any other entry in that object with -i, for example for the "mntner:" attribute.\n\nwhois -h whois.ripe.net -i mnt-by <mntner-name> > inetnum.txt\n\n\nHere is an example:\n\n$ whois -h whois.ripe.net -r 193.174.13.99 > inetnum.txt\n\n$ cat inetnum.txt\n\ninetnum:        193.174.13.0 - 193.174.13.255\nnetname:        DFNCERT-NET\ndescr:          DFN-CERT  Zentrum fuer sichere Netzdienste GmbH\ncountry:        DE\nadmin-c:        KM4692-RIPE\ntech-c:         KM4692-RIPE\nstatus:         ASSIGNED PA\nmnt-by:         DFN-LIR-MNT\ncreated:        2022-08-14T11:48:28Z\nlast-modified:  2022-10-25T12:22:39Z \nsource:         RIPE\n\n\nAdd an mnt-irt: attribute.

The author of the original document was: Marco Thorbrügge, DFN-CERT / thorbruegge@cert.dfn.de Subsequently updated by the RIPE NCC.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Protecting Membership of a Set\n\nWhen membership of a set is specified through the use of the "member-of:" attribute, the server checks the validity of the membership when creating or modifying a member object. This "member-of:" attribute can be used in route(6), aut-num and inet-rtr objects. The value of the "member-of:" attribute identifies a set object that this object wants to be a member of.\n\nThe set object may also have a related "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute, listing the maintainer of the object that wants to be a member of the set. The membership claim of an object with a "member-of:" attribute must be validated. Validation occurs by matching a "mnt-by:" attribute of the object with one of the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes of the set object. If the claim is not valid at the time of creation or modification of a member object (route(6), aut-num or inet-rtr), the operation fails. If a set object has no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the set is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes in the set object. In this case, no other object can validate a claim to be a member of this set. Below is an example of "member-of:" usage:\n\naut-num:     as3333\nmember-of:   as-ripe\nmnt-by:      ripe-dbm-mnt\n\nas-set:      as-ripe\nmbrs-by-ref: ripe-dbm-mnt\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Protection of Address Space\n\nThe inetnum and inet6num objects represent address space allocations and assignments. The "mnt-lower:" attribute is used to reference a mntner object that authorises the creation of more specific inetnum or inet6num objects. If no "mnt-lower:" attribute is present, one of the "mnt-by:" attributes of the parent object will be used instead.\n\nThis parent authorisation is only required when an inetnum or inet6num object is created. This authorisation is in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Protection of AUT-NUM Object Space\n\nProtection of aut-num object space is done using as-block objects. The mntner object that authorises the creation of aut-num objects is specified by any one of the "mnt-lower:" attributes of the parent as-block object. When no "mnt-lower:" attribute exists, the mntner object from any one of the parent "mnt-by:" attributes is used.\n\nThis parent authorisation is only required when an aut-num object is created. It is in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Protection of Objects with Hierarchical Names\n\nRPSL set objects do not have a natural hierarchy of their own but allow hierarchical names, such as the as-set object. An as-set object may have a non-hierarchical name such as "AS-Foo" or a hierarchical name in the form "AS1:AS-BAR".\n\nFor set objects with non-hierarchical names, authorisation corresponds to the rules for individual objects described in the section \'Security of Data Using Authorisation\'.\n\nIf hierarchical names are used, then the creation of an object must be authorised by the object whose primary key is named by everything to the left of the rightmost colon in the primary key name of the object being created. Consider the object "AS1:AS-BAR:AS2". This would need to be authorised by "AS1:AS-BAR". This object is considered to be the \'parent\' of the object being created.\n\nHierarchical authorisation is determined by first using any mntner object referenced by the parent object\'s "mnt-lower:" attributes. If none of these exist, then any mntner object referenced by the parent object\'s "mnt-by:" attributes is used.\n\nThe parent authorisation is required in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself and is only required when an object is created.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Protection of PERSON and ROLE Objects\n\nWhen "mnt-by:" was made mandatory on these objects a circular dependency was created. A person object must be maintained and a mntner must reference an existing person. Therefore, a new user who has no data in the RIPE Database must follow the procedure in the section, \'New Organisation Startup\' to get started.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Protection of Reverse Delegation Objects\n\nProtection of the reverse domain object space for "in-addr.arpa" and "ip6.arpa" domains is done with separate methods for creation, deletion and modification. The domain object creation is described in a flow chart.\n\nThe creation of domain objects for "in-addr.arpa" and "ip6.arpa" domains must satisfy several authorisation criteria. As with all objects, it must satisfy its own mntner object references in the "mnt-by:” attributes. It must also satisfy a hierarchical authorisation. Both authorisations must be passed for the object to be created. For modification and deletion of a domain object, only its own mntner object in the "mnt-by:" attributes needs to authorise the operation. Where a deletion fails, mntner objects referenced in a "mnt-domains", "mnt-lower" or "mnt-by" attribute of the corresponding inet(6)num object can authorise the deletion. They will be checked in this order. The first attribute type found will be taken as the only one to use.\n\nThe hierarchical authorisation uses the related address space objects. An address space object (inetnum or inet6num) with an exact matching prefix will be used; otherwise a less specific prefix is used. One of these objects will always be found in the database. Following this order, the first valid object found is the one used to authorise the new object creation. If the supplied credentials do not satisfy the authorisation required by this first valid object found, then authorisation fails. The software does not look for the next possible valid object in the sequence.\n\nThere is no hierarchy allowed in the reverse domain objects. Therefore, no hierarchical authorisation is required from the domain objects, as is also the case for route objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Protection of Route(6) Object Space\n\nThe route(6) object creation must satisfy several authorisation criteria. As with all objects, it must satisfy its own mntner object references in the "mnt-by:" attributes. It must also satisfy two separate hierarchical authorisations. All three authorisations must be passed for the object to be created. For modify and delete of a route(6) object, only its own mntner object in the "mnt-by:" attributes needs to authorise the operation.\n\nAddress space: the creation of a route(6) object needs to be authorised either by existing, related route(6) objects or related address space objects. The route(6) objects are checked first. If a route(6) object with an exact matching address prefix exists, it will be used for authorisation. If this does not exist, one with a less specific prefix is used. If no such route(6) object exists, an address space object (inetnum or inet6num) with an exact matching prefix will be used, otherwise a less specific prefix is used. One of these objects will always be found in the database. Following this order, the first valid object found is the one used to authorise the new object creation. If the supplied credentials do not satisfy the authorisation required by this first valid object found, then authorisation fails. The software does not look for the next possible valid object in the sequence.\n\nAutonomous System (AS) Number: you do not need to authenticate against the origin AS Number when creating a route(6) object. Any originating AS Number can be used, so long as it’s not in reserved space. The originating AS Number does not need to exist in the RIPE Database.\n\nThe origin AS holder is notified of a route(6) creation, using the "notify:" attribute on the aut-num object, if the both the AS Number exists and the "notify:" attribute is set.\n\nThe RIPE Database is used as an inter-routing registry. However, it is only possible to create a route(6) object in the RIPE Database with an origin prefix that has been allocated to the RIPE region.\n\n\n# Authorisation rules for creating route objects\n\nThe IRR that the RIPE NCC operated is tightly coupled with the RIPE Database, which contains resource and contact information for the address space and ASNs that the RIPE NCC manages. This means that when you query for a certain resource in the RIPE Database, you will also get relevant results from the IRR. Conversely, when entering data into IRR, authorisation for the relevant RIPE Database objects is required.\n\nTo create a route(6) (i.e. a route or route(6)) object in the RIPE database, you must authenticate against the address space you are referring to. Only address space within the RIPE region can be referred to.\n\nWhen creating a route(6) object you must authenticate against multiple maintainers to verify that you have control over the address space you are referring to. This means the related inet(6)num object must exist in the RIPE Database and you can authenticate against it, before you can create a route(6) object in the IRR.\n\nWhen you submit a new route(6) object, the following validation process is triggered:\n\n * The maintainer of any existing route(6) object that is exactly matching or covering a less specific prefix is checked. If there is none, the maintainer of the inet(6)num object that is exactly matching or covering a less specific prefix is checked.\n * If successful, the maintainer of the route(6) object you are creating is verified.\n\nThe order in which the RIPE Database will verify available maintainers is:\n\n * mnt-routes\n * mnt-lower\n * mnt-by\n\nThis means that if a route(6) or inet(6)num object has all three kinds of maintainers defined, you must use the "mnt-routes:" attributes to authenticate. In this case, you cannot use the "mnt-lower:" or "mnt-by:" attributes. Likewise, if you have a "mnt-lower:" and a "mnt-by:" attribute on the objects, the "mnt-lower:" attribute must be used.\n\nHere is a flowchart outlining the entire authorisation process.\n\nYou can only create a route(6) object for a prefix you manage. If these objects are maintained by your organisation\'s single shared maintainer, you just need to supply one credentials to satisfy all of the requirements. However, when you use multiple maintainers, you may need to supply different credentials to create a single route(6) objects.\n\nIf you wish to avoid having to supply multiple credentials, it is best to set up hierarchical authorisation by adding a "mnt-routes:" attribute to all of your resource objects and consistently use this maintainer to create and manage route(6) objects.\n\n\n# Creating route objects referring to resources you don\'t manage\n\nYou do not need to authenticate against the origin AS Number when creating a route(6) object. Any originating AS Number can be used, so long as it\'s not in reserved space. The originating AS Number does not have to exist in the RIPE Database.\n\nIf the originating AS Number exists in the RIPE Database, and if the aut-num object contains one or more notify: attributes, these will be used to notify the originating AS Number holder when the route(6) object is created.\n\n\n# Creating route objects for out-of-region (non-RIPE) resources\n\nIt is not possible to create a route(6) object in the RIPE Routing Registry that refers to a prefix that is not managed by the RIPE NCC, but by one of the other Regional Internet Registries.\n\nThis change was introduced by NWI-5, which is documented in a RIPE Labs article: Out-of-Region ROUTE(6) and AUT-NUM Objects in the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Force deleting blocking route objects\n\nWhen the RIPE Database gets authorisation from the address space for the creation your new route(6) object, it will first check if there is an exact matching or less specific route(6) object. If this route object has a maintainer that you do not have the credentials for, it can block you from creating a new route(6) object. In this case you, as the resource holder, can simply delete the blocking route(6) object.\n\nNormally an object can only be deleted if the operation is authorised by one of the maintainers in the "mnt-by:" attributes of the object to be deleted. However, the force delete functionality also looks for the exact matching, encompassing or less specific address space object that was co-maintained by the RIPE NCC in the hierarchy of the object that is to be deleted. Co-maintained objects include resources that were allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC, and also legacy resources under contract.\n\nThe result is that the "mnt-lower:" attribute of an allocation, or the "mnt-by:" attribute of a PI or anycast assignment, has the authority to reclaim any more specific or related object. Practically, this means a route object can be deleted by:\n\n * the mnt-by: attribute of the route object\n * the mnt-routes: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC\n * the mnt-lower: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the RIPE NCC\n\nIt is important to understand that this functionality only works when the parent inet(6)num object is protected by the RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT or RIPE-NCC-LEGACY-MNT maintainer. If not, the system will look up in the hierarchy until it finds an inet(6)num which has a RIPE NCC maintainer on it, after which it will look at the "mnt-lower:" or "mnt-routes:" attributes on that inet(6)num object and use them for the authentication.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Referencing an IRT Object\n\nThe irt object can be referenced in inetnum and inet6num objects. This reference is made by adding an optional "mnt-irt:" attribute to the inet(6)num object with the value set to the name of the irt object. Adding a reference to an irt object requires authorisation from the irt object. Authorisation can be approved by any of the credentials referenced in any of the "auth:" attributes of the irt object. The authorisation will not default to the "mnt-by:" attributes of the irt object if no suitable credential is found in the "auth:" attributes, and, in this case, the update will fail.\n\nAuthorisation from the irt object is only required when a "mnt-irt:" attribute is added to a referencing object, either on creation or by modification. The irt authorisation is required in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Referencing an ORGANISATION Object\n\nThe organisation object can be referenced in any object. This reference is made by adding an optional "org:" attribute to the referencing object, along with the name of the organisation object. Adding this reference requires authorisation from the organisation object. Authorisation can be approved by any of the mntner objects referenced in any of the "mnt-ref:" attributes of the organisation object. The authorisation will not default to the "mnt-by:" attributes if no suitable maintainer is found in the "mnt-ref:" attributes and, in this case, the update will fail.\n\nAuthorisation from the organisation object is only required when an "org:" attribute is added to a referencing object, either on creation or by modification. This is in addition to the authorisation of the referencing object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# DNSSEC Delegations\n\nThis procedure is in addition to the normal procedure for requesting reverse delegations.\n\n\n# The DOMAIN Object\n\nYou can request reverse delegation by submitting domain objects. DNSSEC will not mean any change the existing authorisation mechanisms. The delegation checker will only carry out DNSSEC specific tests if DNSSEC related information is being exchanged.\n\nTo allow for the exchange of DNSSEC related information, the domain object now includes a "ds-rdata:" attribute.\n\n\n# Delegation Checks\n\nWhen it receives an update, the update engine will perform a number of checks. These are the most important:\n\n * Is there a matching DNSKEY available in the DNS for each "ds-rdata:" attribute that is submitted in the domain object?\n * Is there a valid RRSIG made with the DNSKEY matching the "ds-rdata:"? - The resolution protocol needs this, without it the update will fail.\n * Does the DNSKEY has its "SEP" flag set? Setting the SEP flag is not mandatory. If it is not set, a warning will be produced, however the "ds-rdata:" content will still be copied to the zone.\n * Is the signature validity period close to expiring and are the Times To Live (TTLs) a reasonable fraction of the signature validity period? We suggest the Maximum Zone TTL of your zone data to be a fraction of your signature validity period. If the TTL would be of similar order as the signature validity period, then all RRsets fetched during the validity period would be cached until the signature expiration time. Section 7.1 of Resource Records for the DNS Security Extension suggests that "the resolver may use the time remaining before expiration of the signature validity period of a signed RRset as an upper bound for the TTL". As a result query load on authoritative servers would peak at signature expiration time, as this is also the time at which records simultaneously expire from caches. To avoid query load peaks we suggest the TTL on all the RRs in your zone to be at least a few times smaller than your signature validity period. We currently test on the TTL being at least two times smaller than the signature validity period.\n\nThese tests will only be done for "ds-rdata:" attributes using supported digest types, [section 5.1.3 from RFC4033] (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4033.txt). A Zonemaster check determines whether the digest type is supported.\n\nIf the "ds-rdata:" attribute uses an unsupported digest type, you will see a warning message, however the "ds-rdata:" content will still be copied into the parent zone.\n\nNOTE: The domain objects wizard in the webupdates does not support requesting DNSSEC delegations yet. However, you will be able to use webupdates to add the "ds-rdata:" attribute to an existing domain object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Request ENUM Delegation\n\nENUM is a protocol that is the result of work of the Internet Engineering Task Force\'s (IETF\'s) Telephone Number Mapping Working Group. The charter of this working group was to define a Domain Name System (DNS)-based architecture and protocols for mapping a telephone number to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) which can be used to contact a resource associated with that number.\n\nThe RIPE NCC provides DNS operations for e164.arpa zone(ENUM) is accordance with the Instructions from the Internet Architecture Board.\n\n\n# Requesting Secure Delegation in the ENUM Domain\n\nExample of an ENUM domain object, including a "ds-rdata:" attribute\n\ndomain:     1.3.e164.arpa\ndescr:      Stichting ENUM Nederland\norg:        ORG-SEN3-RIPE\nadmin-c:    MD6066-RIPE\ntech-c:     ENT6-RIPE\nzone-c:     ENT6-RIPE\nnserver:    ns1.enum.nl\nnserver:    ns7.domain-registry.nl\nds-rdata:   10567    5   1   8f138cd3e55db6590f51fe47e390a2d1743b5bd4\nmnt-by:     ENUM-NL-MNT\nsource:     RIPE # Filtered\n\n\n\n# The four steps to updating an ENUM delegation to have a secure DS record in e164.arpa\n\n 1. Setup you server to serve a secure zone\n    \n    Ensure that the zone you are serving is signed and it contains a Key Signing Key (KSK) marked with the SEP flag.\n\n 2. Create your domain object\n    \n    The "ds-rdata:" attribute of your domain object should be created by performing a hash over the SEP KSK key. An easy way to create a domain object which includes the ds-rdata: hash is to visit the RIPE NCC Delegation Checker, input your zone name and follow the instructions provided. The end result will be a domain object you can use in the next step.\n\n 3. Submitting the domain object Once you have set up your sever(s) to serve the ENUM zones you are ready to request delegation by submitting a domain object:\n    \n    1. By using webupdates\n       \n       * First authorise yourself in the authorisation section. Then go to the add section\n       * Select domain, by clicking on \'Create a New Object\' and then click on \'Add Object\'\n       * Fill in all the available fields\n       * Use the \'Add New Field\' feature to add at least two "nserver:" attributes. Here, you supply the names of the name servers that are serving the zones as set up in Step 3 and that you have specified in the NS resource records of those zones\n       * For the "mnt-by:" attribute use the mntner you prepared in Step 1\n    \n    2. By email You need to create a domain object containing information about the zone you need reverse delegation for. For further information go here\n    \n    3. Verifying the setup Once you have submitted the domain object you will receive a notification.\n       \n       You should then be able to query for your object in the RIPE Database: whois -h whois.ripe.net 1.3.e164.arpa After the object appears in the RIPE Database it may take between 15 and 60 minutes before the delegation information is available in the DNS.\n       \n       The ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n       \n       Please contact us if, six hours after the appearance of your domain object in the database, your delegation does not appear. Include the details such as name server addresses and the domain object in your request. Also include the full response, including headers, as received from the database.\n       \n       Any resolver which has the DNSSEC public key for e164.arpa configured should now return DNS answers which have the authenticated data bit set.\n\n\n# Additional Notes\n\nFrom time to time, you may have to roll the keys in your zone. When you do this, make sure that you also update the ds-rdata information. This places a new DS record in the parent zone.\n\nFor further details on rolling keys and other important information on DNSSEC operational practices we recommend reading RFC 4641.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Security of Data Using Authorisation\n\nIndividual data objects must be protected with a mntner object. The mntner is referenced by the "mnt-by:" attribute in the object. This attribute is defined as multiple in all object types, so several mntner objects can be used to protect one object.\n\nOnly those mntner objects referenced by the "mnt-by:" attributes are authorised to modify or delete the object. Authorisation checks work in line with the logical “OR” - for the operation to be authorised, you must supply information required by at least one credential from one of the referenced mntner objects. As you can supply information required by any credential for the operation to be authorised, this means that an object\'s protection level is determined by the weakest authorisation method used in the mntner objects referenced by that object.\n\nWhen the "mnt-by:" attribute is added to an object for the first time (as part of object creation or modification), the operation should pass authorisation checks for at least one of the mntner objects referenced by one of the "mnt-by:" attributes.\n\nIf the operation is a modification and the old object already has one or more "mnt-by:" attributes, then one of the mntner objects referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes in the old object must authorise the change. If the old object does not have any "mnt-by:" attributes, then one of the mntner objects referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes in the new object must authorise the change. All new objects must have at least one "mnt-by:". There are still some historic person and role objects that do not have any "mnt-by:" attributes.\n\nAuthorisation is also used in a hierarchical way. Much of the operational data in the RIPE Database is structured hierarchically. For example, the address space is allocated in large blocks, which can then be divided in a number of ways and then finally assigned to End Users. Authorisation in a hierarchy works from the top down to the bottom. So each child object needs to be authorised by the holder of the parent object. There are a range of additional attributes for this including "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:".\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Using the Authorisation Methods\n\n * MD5 Password\n * PGP Key\n * X.509 Certificate\n * Single Sign-On\n\n\n# MD5 Password\n\nAn MD5 password can be used by any of the update methods currently in use. See section 5.2 Update Methods for more details of these methods.\n\nFor email updates, password authorisation information is supplied using a "password:" pseudo-attribute. The value of this attribute is a clear-text passphrase, corresponding to the encrypted hash. It can appear anywhere in the body of the message, but not within mail headers. Line continuation is not allowed for this attribute. The attribute and the passphrase should fit on one line. If you split the passphrase across multiple lines, this will be treated as a syntax error. If you have a very long passphrase, please note that some email clients split lines at a pre-defined character position. If multiple passwords are required, a "password:" pseudo-attribute must be included in the update for each password. The Webupdates web form includes a ‘Session Passwords\' field. Many passwords can be added, one at a time, using this field, up to a pre-defined limit. For any update in this session, all session passwords will be added to the update that is performed via the web form.\n\nIn the single text area form of Webupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added as part of the update body, in the text area, in the same way as with an email update. The session passwords also apply in this case.\n\nUsing the Syncupdates web form there is no ‘Session Passwords\' field but again the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added. When using the HTTP POST and GET requests for Syncupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute must be supplied as part of the message body.\n\nWith the RESTful API, any required passwords must be included in the URI query parameters. For more details see the API documentation.\n\n\n# PGP Key\n\nTo use PGP authentication you must first create a private/public key pair. There are many third-party applications that will allow you to do this. You must keep the private key secure. The public key is entered into the RIPE Database in a key-cert object. (See \'Description of the key-cert Object\' for details.)\n\nSome email clients allow you to import your private key into the client. This can then be used to sign any email update you submit. Alternatively, you can use third-party software to sign an update with your private key and paste the signed update into the body of an email.\n\nA signed update message can also be pasted into the Syncupdates web form. When using the HTTP POST and GET requests for Syncupdates, the signed update must be supplied in the message body.\n\nPGP-signed updates cannot be submitted using the RESTful API. As Webupdates uses the API in the background, you cannot paste a signed update into a Webupdates text area either.\n\nFor your PGP-signed update to pass authentication checks, you must have your public key in the database in a key-cert object.\n\nPGP authentication creation steps are in the appendix.\n\n\n# Use in the MAINTAINER object\n\nPGP authentication can be activated by setting the value of an "auth:" attribute to PGPKEY-<id> where <id> is the PGP key ID to be used for authentication. This string is the same one which is used in the corresponding key-cert object\'s "key-cert:" attribute.\n\nRemember that if you have multiple "auth:" attributes in a maintainer or if you have multiple "mnt-by:" attributes in an object, all possible authentication methods are combined by a logical OR which means that any single one of the specified authentication methods can be used. There is not security advantage in using PGP authentication with an object which can also be updated with password authentication.\n\nThere are currently no referential integrity checks carried out on the "auth:" attribute values. If you change your "auth:" to refer to a non existent key-cert object, or someone else\'s key-cert object you have locked your mntner. You will then have to contact us for assistance to un-lock it. Also, if you delete your key-cert object you will again lock your mntner until you re-create the key-cert object.\n\nThis is an example of a valid mntner object which uses PGP authentication:\n\nmntner:         EXAMPLE-MNT\ndescr:          Example maintainer\nadmin-c:        JOE1-RIPE\nupd-to:         joe@example.net\nauth:           PGPKEY-4B8AE00D\nmnt-by:         EXAMPLE-MNT\ncreated:        2022-10-26T11:38:51Z\nlast-modified:  2022-10-26T11:38:51Z\nsource:         RIPE\n\n\n\n# Using authentication when sending updates\n\nPGP signed updates can be sent to the database simply by signing the body of the message containing the updates and sending it to the server. Remember to use ASCII armoring.\n\nMultiple GP-signed and non-signed parts can be supplied in a single update message, each part is processed separately. You can supply several objects which are protected by different PGP keys in a single update message, providing all required signatures are present.\n\nPGP parts with invalid signatures are handled as plain text. If the object is protected by an authentication method other than PGP, or has multiple authentication schemes in use and the required authentication is present, it will still be authorised. If PGP is the only form of authentication present the authentication will fail.\n\nPGP authentication can be mixed with any of the other forms of authentication in the same mntner object. Each authentication method used can have multiple instances present. All the authentications present in a mntner object are processed with a logical \'OR\' to determine if the authentication is passed.\n\nPGP can be used with updates submitted by e-mail or using the syncupdates facility. It cannot be used with the webupdates interface.\n\n\n# X.509 Certificate\n\nThis is handled in a similar way to PGP. You need a certificate and private key. There is third-party software available to generate these as well as command-line tools, for example OpenSSL. The certificate must be included in a key-cert object in the database. The generated certificate and private key are in binary files. The OpenSSL tool will convert the certificate into plain text to be included in the key-cert object. For X.509 key-cert objects, you must specify the "key-cert:" value as ‘AUTO-1\'. The database software will then set this value. These values cannot be reused. Once deleted, an X.509 key-cert object cannot be recreated.\n\nIf your email client supports S/MIME you can import the certificate and private key into the client. Email updates can now be signed with your X.509 private key. Alternatively, you can sign your update using your private key with OpenSSL and paste it into the email message body.\n\nA signed update message can also be pasted into the Syncupdates web form. When using the HTTP POST and GET requests for Syncupdates, the signed update must be supplied in the message body.\n\nX.509 signed updates cannot be submitted via the RESTful API. Additionally, since Webupdates utilizes the API in the background, you are unable to paste a signed update into a Webupdates text area. However, you can submit updates through the RESTful API using Client Certificate Authentication.\n\nFor your X.509 signed update to pass authorisation checks, you must have your certificate in the database in a key-cert object.\n\n\n# Single Sign-On\n\nThe SSO (single sign-on) authorisation is different to all the other methods. This one provides some authentication as well. SSO is based on RIPE NCC Access. To use SSO as an authorisation method in the RIPE Database, you must first create a RIPE NCC Access account. This provides some details about who you are. It is no longer a totally anonymous password in a box (where the box is the mntner object).\n\nThe RIPE NCC Access account username, which is your email address, becomes the authorisation credential used by the database software. If you change your RIPE NCC Access username to a different email address, this is immediately reflected in the mntner object.\n\nCurrently SSO authorisation only works with web-based update methods. This includes Webupdates and the Syncupdates web form. You need to sign in to your RIPE NCC Access account in order to authorise an update.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Available Databases\n\nAn update is the submission of information for entry into, or removal from, a database. As the database records are RPSL objects, these updates create, modify or delete one or more objects.\n\nThere are several databases that can be updated and a number of ways in which you can submit an update. Each of the databases described below have a fully operating software system built around them. This includes the core database software as well as the external interfaces, for example email service, Webupdates, Syncupdates and RESTful API.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Experimental Databases\n\nThere are times when some features need to be deployed in a proof of concept mode. It may be an idea that some community users have suggested but does not yet have widespread support. A proof of concept software release can be made and a temporary database, similar to the RC Database, set up to demonstrate the feature. That database will be a full copy of the production database with dummified personal data and modified mntner object credentials.\n\nSimilar projects may be set up when a major data migration project is proposed. A test run may be carried out on a database copy and this may be made available to the community to review what their data looks like after the change.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Release Candidate Database (RC)\n\nThe release procedure for new software requires the new system to be available in a test environment for a period of time. This test environment is built around the RC Database. This is a fully functioning service where all your client software can be tested against the new software release. The RC database is dummified to remove personal data. Also all mntner object authorisation tokens are set to a password using the mntner object name. This allows more flexibility, as you can create objects that are only created by the RIPE NCC in the production version, Other than that, it is an exact copy of the production database, with the copy made at some point in time close to the software release date.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE Database is the authoritative database and is sometimes referred to as the ‘live’ or ‘production’ database or service. This holds all the current data for all the existing RPSL objects. It also holds historical data for deleted objects and previous versions of the current objects. Most operational services and tools are built around this database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# TEST Database\n\nThis database is provided as an operational service to all users. It allows anyone to try out updates or changes to their data. New users can set up any data they like and practise making updates and doing queries.\n\nThe TEST Database works in exactly the same way as the production service, for most of its operations. Some rules are relaxed and some mntner objects have the password included in a "remarks:" attribute. This allows users to create objects in this TEST Database that only the RIPE NCC can create in the production database. If you want to copy your allocation and build a copy of your network you can do this in the TEST Database.\n\nEach evening, at midnight (UTC) the whole contents of this database are deleted. It is then reset with a standard, basic set of objects. This prevents anyone from creating large objects and blocking off huge pieces of the address space. So if you are testing anything that will take you more than a day to complete, you need to build your objects in a text file that you can either paste into a syncupdates web page or submit as an email update. Make sure you order them in the text file to match how you actually created them. If you get the order wrong, some may fail when you re-submit them. You can add to the text file as you create or change data in the database. Then the next day, you can recreate the whole set of objects to the point you reached previously and continue with your tests.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Database Support\n\n\n# RIPE Database Support\n\nThe RIPE Database contains registration details of IP addresses and AS Numbers originally allocated by the RIPE NCC. It shows the organisations that hold the resources, where the allocations were made, and contact details for the networks.\n\n\n# Problems with Spam?\n\nWhat can the RIPE NCC do about spam? Who can I report this to? How do I take things further? What you can do about network abuse\n\n\n# Database Working Group\n\nThe Database Working Group deals with all issues related to the RIPE Database. Changes of existing objects, creation of new objects and features, and distribution of databases and security issues are discussed here. Join the Working Group\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Clean-up of Unreferenced Data\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nAny data entered into the RIPE Database must comply with the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions. Over a period of time, data is changed and references are removed. This often results in many of the secondary objects (for example organisation, person, role and mntner objects) being left in the database and serving no useful purpose. In order to keep the database clean and to comply with data protection rules, this unnecessary data must be removed. New personal data should not be stored in the RIPE Database beyond a reasonable "work in progress" period before it is referenced by operation data objects.\n\n\n# Authority\n\nCleaning up this data has been discussed many times at RIPE Meetings and on the mailing list of the RIPE Database Working Group\n\nThe authority to clean-up this data was first given to the RIPE NCC at the RIPE 40 Meeting in Prague in 2001\n\nThe scope was expanded at the RIPE 41 Meeting in Amsterdam in 2002\n\nA clean-up process to do periodic clean-ups was put in place in 2003. However, this process proved to be inadequate and the number of unreferenced objects continued to grow.\n\nThe issue was raised again at the RIPE 54 Meeting in Tallinn in 2007, continued on the RIPE Database Working Group mailing list throughout 2007 and then consensus was reached at the RIPE 56 Meeting in Berlin in 2008.\n\n\n# Process\n\nA simplistic implementation that cleaned up unreferenced person and role objects was started on 26 january 2009. However, since this approach was incomplete (e.g. it did not detect person-maintainer pairs as described below) it was largely ineffective. The process was therefore stopped again on 21 March 2014.\n\nSince 6 September 2016 the RIPE NCC has implemented a more complete clean-up process for the following object types:\n\n * organisation\n * person\n * role\n * mntner\n\nIf the organisation, person or role object is unreferenced, it is eligible to be deleted. If a person or role object is only referenced in a mntner object and the mntner object only references that person or role object, then both the mntner and the person or role objects are eligible to be deleted.\n\nTo be deleted, they must be unreferenced by any other object, and must not have been referenced by any aut-num, domain, inet(6)num, route(6), as-set, filter-set, inet-rtr, peering-set, route-set, rtr-set, as-block, key-cert or irt object during the last 90 days.\n\nNotifications of the deletion of objects will be sent to anyone who has optionally included a "notify:" attribute in the person, role or mntner objects, or a "mnt-nfy:" attribute in the mntner objects. These notifications include a link to this page.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Configuring Reverse DNS\n\nComputer networks use the Domain Name System (DNS) to determine the IP address associated with a domain name. This process is also known as forward DNS resolution. Reverse DNS (rDNS) is the inverse process of this: the resolution of an IP address to its designated domain name. This document explains how reverse DNS works and how to configure it for your zone\n\n\n# Reverse DNS Overview\n\nThe reverse DNS database of the Internet works with a hierarchical tree of servers, just like forward DNS. It is rooted in the Address and Routing Parameter Area (arpa) top-level domain of the Internet. One level below the arpa root are the delegated servers in-addr.arpa for IPv4 and ip6.arpa for IPv6.\n\nFurther down the tree, there are delegations for the /8 blocks that IANA allocated to the RIRs, the allocations that the RIRs gave to the address holders, all the way down to the individual IP addresses and names that you have configured for your Internet-enabled hosts. The process of reverse resolving an IP address uses the pointer DNS record type (PTR record).\n\n\n\nIn order to do a DNS lookup for data that is associated with a certain IP address, you should map the IP addresses into the DNS name hierarchy. This means that, as an address holder, you will have to configure two things. Forst, you have to configure your zone for reverse DNS. Second, you have to request reverse delegation of your zone. The second part is one by creating a domain bject in the RIPE Database.\n\nBefore you can submit the domain object to the RIPE Database, you will first have to configure reverse DNS for your zone on at least two name servers. Upon submission, the RIPE Database will perform checks to see if your name servers are configured properly. If so, delegation will be propagated to the DNS by the RIPE NCC\'s name servers.\n\n\n# Mapping IP addresses into the DNS name hierarchy\n\nFor IPv4, the mapping of the reverse address space can only happen on "byte" boundaries, i.e. multiples of 8 bits. This means that you should take the four octets - the decimal numbers between the dots - of an IP address range, put them in reverse order and then map them into the in-addr.arpa domain.\n\nFor example, an address (A) record for mail.example.com points to the IP address 192.0.2.5. In pointer record of the reverse database, this IP address is stored as the domain name 5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. pointing back to its designated host name mail.example.com. The resulting PTR record would look like this:\n\n5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. 3600 IN PTR mail.example.com\n\n\nReverse DNS for IPv6 uses the hexadecimal notation on "nibble" boundaries, i.e. multiples of 4 bits. This means you should take the IPv6 address, expand all the zerps, put each hexadecimal number in reverse order and map them into the ip6.arpa domain.\n\nFor example, the pointer domain name corresponding to the IPv6 address 2001:db8::567:89ab is b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa., which would result in this PTR record:\n\nb.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. 3600 IN PTR mail.example.com.\n\n\n\n# Dealing with multiple zones for one address block\n\nBecause the particular mapping delegation of reverse address space can only happen on byte boundaries for IPv4 and nibble boundaries for IPv6, you could be dealing with multiple zones for one address block.\n\nIPv4 One or more /24 type zones need to be created if your address space has a prefix length between /17 and /24. If your prefix length is between /16 and /9 you will have to request one or more delegations for /16 type zones.\n\nFor example, if you have been allocated 10.155.16.0/22, you need to create four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nIPv6 If you have been allocated an IPv6 block that is not on a nibble boundary, you will need to go down to the next nibble and create multiple zones to cover the entire block.\n\nFor example, an allocation such as 2001:db8::/29 will result in eight reverse zones of /32 each:\n\n8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n9.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\na.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nb.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nc.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nd.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\ne.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nf.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n\n\n\n# Creating DOMAIN Objects for Reverse DNS\n\n\n# Step 1: Set up authorisation\n\nThe creation and maintenance of domain objects must be handled by a designated maintainer. You can use an existing maintainer or create a specific one for the people who will be creating and managing domain objects. You should refer to this maintainer using the "mnt-domains:" attribute in inetnum object for the address block that you hold. You will be able to add the "mnt-domains:" attribute in the RIPE Database, for example using webupdates. If you are an LIR, you may need to select your default maintainer first, before you can add this attribute.\n\n\n# Step 2: Configure your DNS server\n\nConfigure your DNS servers in such a way that you will pass all the tests that we will perform. Here are some recommendations to help you:\n\n * Make sure you set up at least two name servers that are authoritative for the zone\n * Ensure that the servers are at least in different subnets, but preferably in different networks that are geographically distributed.\n * The resolvable names of these name servers should be in the NS resource records of the zone.\n * The SOA resource record (RR) should have the same content, both serial number and other data, on all the name servers.\n * The SOA should contain a valid "RNAME" (the contact address)\n * The timing parameters should be reasonable\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your configuration, we recommend that you perform a test fo your setup using the DNSCheck tool so you can find and resolve any problems.\n\n\n# Step 3a: Create your domain objects using webupdates\n\nWhen you submit a domain object you are requesting reverse delegation, asking the RIPE NCC to enter NS records pointing to your name servers in RIPE NCC\'s parent zone. The domain object has the following mandatory attributes:\n\ndomain:   <zone name>\nadmin-c:  <nic-handle for administrative contact>\ntech-c:   <nic-handle for technical contact>\nzone-c:   <nic-handle for zone contact>\nnserver:  <primary name server>\nnserver:  <secondary name server>\nmnt-by:   <your maintainer>\nsource:   RIPE\n\n\nIn the web interface for the RIPE Database, there is a wizard that will automatically create one or more domain objects for you. It allows you to fill in an IPv4 or IPv6 prefix and the wizard will take care of creating one or multiple reverse zones out of it. After filling in your name servers, the wizard will also perform a basic check to see if the name servers are online. The full set of tests will happen after you submit the form. A one-minute video with a demonstration is available online.\n\n\n\nAfter you have entered all of the required fields you can submit the form. Depending on the amount of domain objects that are going to be created, it can take up to several minutes for the process to complete. The tests return log level information, categorised as INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL. We reject any update that has ERROR or CRITICAL for any test. If this happens to you, resolve the problem and try completing the wizard again.\n\nIf the update was successful, the success page will show you the first couple of domain objects that were created, along with a link to the full list. Still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the DNS. The ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# Step 3b: Create your domain objects using syncupdates, email or the API\n\nIf you choose to create domain objects using syncupdates, email or the API, you will first need to chop your address block into "chunks" that can be delegated. For example, if you have been allocated 10.155.16/22, you need to create four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nIn the "domain:" attribute, you specify the name of the reverse zone, e.g. "16.155.10.in-addr.arpa". As discussed, you will have to do this for each "chunk" you have created. If you need reverse delegation for a /22 block, you will need to create four domain objects, one for each /24.\n\nEnter all other attributes and submit your domain object to the RIPE Database. After verifying syntax and authorisation, we will perform a number of tests to see if you configured reverse DNS correctly. The tests return log level information, categorised as INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL. We reject any update that has ERROR or CRITICAL for any test. If this happens to you, resolve the problem and try submitting the domain object again.\n\nIf the update was successful, you should then be able to query for your object in the RIPE Database. Still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the DNS. The ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# Requesting DNSSEC Delegations\n\nTo allow for the exchange of DNSSEC-related information, the domain object includes a "ds-rdata:" attribute.\n\nIn DNSSEC, the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record is created from a DNSkey resource record by comparing it with the public key. The parent publishes the DS resource record. The "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the RDATA of the DS resource records related to the domain, as shown in the "domain:" attribute.\n\nds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278BF194C29A812B33935BB2517E17D1486210FA\n\n\nThe tools provided with BIND (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. You should copy the DS RDATA into the "ds-data:" attributes.\n\nWhen we receive a domain object with DNSSEC-related information, we will carry out additional tests.\n\n\n# Automated update of DNSSEC Delegations\n\nWhenever you want to change the DNSSEC key whose digest is in the "ds-rdata:" attribute, it is necessary to update the attribute. This can be done manually using any means of RIPE Database update methods or automatically using a special Child Delegation Signed (CDS) DNS record. This procedure works as follows:\n\n * The reverse domain has to be already DNSSEC-secured.\n * Whenever a change in "ds-rdata:" attribute is required, you should publish a CDS record at the apex (root) of your reverse zone.\n * RIPE NCC regularly scans all DNSSEC-secured reverse domains for CDS records.\n * If a CDS record is found whose contents differ from the current "ds-rdata:" attribute and all safety measures (see below) are fulfilled, RIPE NCC will update the domain object on your behalf.\n\nThere are some additional requirements mandated by RFC 7344 in order to ensure the process is hardened against accidents and abuse:\n\n * The CDS record set is properly signed by a key represented in the DS record of the parent zone. This usually means that the CDS record set has to be signed by Key-Signing Key (KSK) instead of Zone-Signing Key (ZSK).\n * Applying the CDS record must not break the DNSSEC delegation. Therefore for each DNSSEC algorithm present in the CDS record set, there has to be at least one matching key in the DNSKEY record set with a proper signature.\n * The inception date of the DNSSEC signature of the CDS record set must not be older than the date stored in the "last- modified:" attribute of the domain object.\n\nIt is also possible to switch to insecure delegation by publishing a special CDS record containing "0 0 0 00". Please note that this is a one way process. Once the reverse domain is switched to insecure, you have to add the "ds-rdata:" attribute manually to activate DNSSEC again.\n\n\n# Reverse DNS Troubleshooting\n\nHere is an overview of the most common warnings and errors that the reverse delegation checker reports, along with the likely causes and suggested solutions.\n\nERROR                                                         LIKELY CAUSE AND SUGGESTED SOLUTION\nERROR: No SOA RR were found.

Each role object has a unique NIC handle ("nic-hdl:").\n\n\n# What is a NIC handle?\n\nNIC handles are unique identifiers of roles.\n\nIt is basically the role\'s unique ID and it helps to keep different roles with the same name apart from each other.\n\nWhenever a role object is referenced in another object they are referenced by their NIC handle ("nic-hdl:") and not by their name.\n\n\n# What is a MNTNER (pronounced "maintainer")?\n\nAll objects in the RIPE Database must be protected using mntner objects. A mntner object specifies authentication information required to authorise creation, deletion or modification of the objects protected by the mntner.\n\nThe value of the "mnt-by" attribute is the name of the maintainer (mntner) object that will protect the object.\n\nTo create a role object and a mntner object at the same time, go to the web application.\n\nFor more information about maintainers and hierarchical authorisation, please see [\'Authorisation Model\'].\n\nTo find out how to create role and mntner objects, and to protect objects using your mntner, see the e-learning course.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Database Business Rules\n\nThe RIPE Database contains objects formatted according to the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL), which has a set of syntax rules you have to comply with when creating, updating or deleting objects. In addition, the RIPE NCC enforces certain business rules to ensure data integrity and registry accuracy. This document gives an overview of all current business rules.\n\nAPPLIES TO OBJECT TYPE             ON ACTION        BUSINESS RULE\nall                                Create           An object cannot be created if it already exists.

To facilitate this, there is a dedicated object which is used to protect all other objects you manage: the maintainer. This page explains how to set up a maintainer for yourself and your organisation, as well as handling delegation of authorisation to other parties.\n\nThe maintainer (mntner) object is used to protect other objects in the RIPE Database. This is done by referring to the maintainer from the object you want to protect, using the "mnt-by:" attribute. The maintainer contains one or more authentication methods that you can use to authorise making changes to your objects.\n\n\n\nMaintainers are anonymous. Other than the authentication references they contain, there is nothing that ties them to a specific person, group or organisation. Authentication is handled as a "logical OR", meaning that if you know one of several credentials associated with a maintainer, you can make changes to the objects that refer to it. In the example above, two people can use their RIPE NCC Access (single sing-on) account to make changes to the inet6num object, or the PGP key can be used. Which authentication method is best for your use case is explained in a separate section: Protecting your data in the RIPE Database.\n\nMost commonly, a maintainer object is maintained by itself, meaning that the "mnt-by:" attribute of the maintainer refers to the same object. If you want to edit details, for example add or remove an authentication, you simply need to use one of the existing authentication methods. In the example above, one of the three authentications can be used to add a forth, such as new colleague joining the team.\n\nWhat makes the maintainer system flexible is the fact that you have a lot of freedom in: * The number of maintainer objects you create * The number of maintainers you refer to from each RIPE Database object * The kind and number of authentication methods you use in each maintainer * Delegation of authorisation to a specific person or group * Controlling what kind of objects a certain group can create (such as route(6), domain and inet(6)num objects)\n\nGiven this flexibility, you must ensure you make the right choices when setting up authorisation. There are some important concepts and best practices to keep in mind which are explained in each of the following sections.\n\n\n# The Default Maintainer\n\nIf you are an LIR and you have received Internet Number Resources, several objects are created by the RIPE NCC in the RIPE Database to reflect this. These objects are managed by the RIPE NCC, but you have control over some attributes, such as setting the administrative and technical contact person. In order to allow you to make these changes, an additional maintainer will be present on the object, the so-called "default" maintainer. You have to select this maintainer on the Account Details page and this will be reflected in the "mnt-by:" attribute on all existing and new objects that have joint responsibility: top level allocations for IP resources (inet(6)num and aut-num objects) and the organisation object. If you had a previous default maintainer the new default maintainer will replace your previous one.\n\nAfter selecting the default maintainer, you can change all of the attributes you could previously modify by using the Object Editors - such as technical, administrative and abuse contact details - Through the RIPE Database itself. You can use any update method you like, e.g. webupdates, syncupdates or email updates.\n\n\n# Personal Maintainers Versus Shared Maintainers\n\nWhen you first use the RIPE Database, you need to create some basic objects. Every object you create in the database must be maintained. That means you need a mntner object. This object must reference a role (or person) object as a contact. However, the role (or person) object must be maintained. Therefore, a user cannot create either of these two objects first using any of the usual update methods. This means when you start using the RIPE Database, you first step would be to create a role and maintainer pair for yourself.\n\nMost other objects, especially the ones that are related to your resources, should be editable by you and your colleagues in the IT department or Network Operations Centre. For these objects you should be using a single maintainer that is shared by a group of people. In most cases, this maintainer was created when you registered as a RIPE NCC member or became a resource holder in another way. If not, it is always possible to create a shared maintainer at a later point.\n\nKeep in mind that sharing a maintainer doesn\'t mean sharing the credentials as well, such as a password or a key. As explained earlier, a maintainer can contain multiple authentication attributes, so each person that has access to it can use their own set of credentials.\n\n\n# Delegating Authorisation Using Maintainers\n\nThe idea behind delegation of authorisation is that you can authorise a certain group (either within or outside your organisation) to create objects under a certain parent object that you control. For example, your can allow your colleagues who are responsible for the BGP routing configuration to create route(6) objects to register the announcement in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR), and nothing else. Likewise, you can authorise your DNS group to request Reverse Delegation by creating a domain object and nothing else.\n\nFor this purpose, three attributes exist:\n\n* "mnt-lower:", for hierarchical control over one level more specific objects\n* "mnt-routes:", for the creation of **route(6)** objects in the IRR\n* "mnt-domains:", for requesting Reverse Delegation of DNS by creating a **domain** object\n\n\nThe "mnt-lower:" attribute specifies an existing mntner object used for hierarchical authorisation. It controls creation of objects one level more specific in the hierarchy of an object type (this only applies to inetnum, inet6num, as-block, aut-num, route, route6, or domain objects).\n\nThe most common occurrence of the "mnt-lower:" attribute is in the IP address allocation(s) that you have received from the RIPE NCC. For example, if you are an LIR and you have an IPv6 allocation, it is represented in the RIPE Database as an inet6num object. Because the allocation is managed by the RIPE NCC, one of the "mnt-by:" attributes is set to RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT and the other is set by you after choosing the default maintainer. These are some of the attributes you would see:\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        LIR-ORG-RIPE\nstatus:     ALLOCATED\nmnt-by:     RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:     LIR-NOC-MNT \n\n\nThe RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT maintainer prevents you from making changes to some of the attributes that are part of the RIPE NCC\'s registry management, such as the "netname:". Your LIR\'s default maintainer allows you to make changes to attributes you manage, such as the "admin-c:" and "tech-c:". In addition, it allows you to create assignments, as well as route(6) and domain objects under this parent block. However, if you wish to delegate the creation of child resource objects to a separate group, you can do so by creating an additional maintainer for them and specify it as "mnt-lower:":\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        LIR-ORG-RIPE\nstatus:     ALLOCATED\nmnt-by:     RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:     LIR-NOC-MNT\nmnt-lower:  LIR-IPMGMT-MNT\n\n\nLikewise, you can delegate control over the creation of **route(6)**and domain objects by adding a "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attribute to the allocation. Keep in mind that you first have to select a default maintainer before you can do this. The resulting allocation object would look something like this:\n\ninet6num:    2001:db8::/32\norg:         LIR-ORG-RIPE\nstatus:      ALLOCATED\nmnt-by:      RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by:      LIR-NOC-MNT\nmnt-lower:   LIR-IPMGMT-MNT\nmnt-routes:  LIR-RTRMGMT-MNT\nmnt-domains: LIR-DNSMGMT-MNT\n\n\nAfter you have done this, you can achieve fine-grained control over the creation of inet(6)num, route(6) and domain objects.\n\nIn this example, route and domain objects are managed by separate maintainers: LIR-RTRMGMT-MNT and LIR-DNSMGMT-MNT respectively, as specified in the allocation. IN addition, a "nt-lower:" was specified in the aggregate prefix for the broadband pool (2001:db8::/36). This allows for the creation of more specific objects below it by LIR-BROADBAND-MNT:\n\n\n\nIn general, keep in mind that when as inet(6)num, route(6) or a domain object is created, authentication is required from the parent object. If the parent has a "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" or "mnt-domains:" attribute, this is the mntner that will need to be authenticated against. Otherwise the parent "mnt-by:" attribute is used.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Highlighted Values in the RIPE Database\n\nThis function highlights values in the RIPE Database that are maintained by the RIPE NCC. These values are subject to an established due diligence process, which is described in the RIPE NCC procedural document Due Diligence for the Quality of the RIPE NCC Registration Data.\n\n\n# Non-highlighted Values\n\nObjects in the RIPE Database are mostly created and updated by users. The RIPE NCC makes every effort possible within its resources to keep the RIPE Database clean of false, obsolete and unnecessary data. However, the RIPE NCC cannot guarantee the accuracy of all data in the RIPE Database.\n\nInaccurate values in the RIPE Database, whether highlighted or not, should be reported to the RIPE NCC via the contact form.\n\n\n# Data not Published in the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE NCC keeps a comprehensive record of all Internet number resources registered within the RIPE NCC service region to ensure that each Resource Holder holds unique and legitimate IP address space and ASNs.\n\nThe collective of these data is generally referred to as the "RIPE Registry". Information in the RIPE Registry is subject to the specific and rigorous due diligence checks referred to above. As the RIPE Registry contains information that is subject to data protection laws and to confidentiality agreements between the RIPE NCC and its membership, much of this information cannot be made publicly available. Information from the RIPE Registry that appears in the RIPE Database is not restricted by confidentiality agreements.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Support Overview\n\n\n# User Manuals\n\n * RIPE Database Document Library Manuals and reference material for new and experienced user of the RIPE Database\n * Organisation Object in the RIPE Database About the organisation Object\n\n\n# Security\n\n * Protecting your data in the RIPE Database Various security methods available to RIPE Database users\n * Using PGP with the RIPE Database Several links to documents explaining how to use PGP for authentication\n * IRT Object - Technical How To Guide How to handle the Incident Response Team(IRT) object in the RIPE Database\n\n\n# Operational\n\n * Clean-up of Unreferenced Data - Detailed explanation with examples Database cleanup process described in detail with examples of data subject to deletion.\n * Near Real Time Mirroring v3 NRTM allows any authorised clients to receive a stream of available data from a database on a server.\n * Near Real Time Mirroring NRTM allows any client to receive a stream of available data from a database on a server.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n\n# What is the RIPE Database?\n\nThe RIPE Database contains information about:\n\n * Allocations and assignments of IP address space\n * Routing Registry Information\n * Reverse DNS Delegations\n * Related objects\n\nThe data is entered into the RIPE Database mainly by operators of IP networks within the RIPE NCC service region. These are the maintainers of the data. The RIPE NCC supports the operation of the RIPE Database. The maintainers are primarily responsible for the data but the RIPE NCC also has some responsibility as a Database Controller. The responsibilities are explained in more detail in the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe data is accessible by Whois query (whois.ripe.net) and through a web interface, subject to the RIPE Database terms and conditions.\n\n\n# What is acceptable use of the RIPE Database?\n\nThe purpose and use of the RIPE Database is defined in the RIPE Database terms and conditions. The purpose of the RIPE Database is to assist the operation of the Internet in the RIPE region. Use of information from the RIPE Database for activities such as marketing, advertising and distributing Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) is covered by the Terms and Conditions.\n\n\n# What is a netname?\n\nA netname is a mandatory attribute of an inetnum object which contains a short but meaningful name of the IP allocation or assignment. Two or more inetnum objects can have the same netname. The netname attribute is a look-up key, one can query the RIPE Database supplying the netname as an argument. The result of the query will show all inetnum objects with that netname.\n\n\n# What is a nic-hdl?\n\nA "nic-handle" is a unique identifier that references RIPE Database objects containing contact details for a specific person or role. Other RIPE Database objects list contact details by their nic-handle. This is a more reliable identifier than an email address or a person\'s name (which may not be unique).\n\n\n# Can I use a nic-handle from another Regional Internet Registry Database in the RIPE Database?\n\nYes, but you must create a person/role object in the RIPE Database to ensure referential integrity. There is no existing distributed database of person/role objects (i.e. contact information). Please note that updating an object in one database does not mean the object will be updated in any other database.\n\n\n# What is a tech-c and what is an admin-c?\n\nAn "admin-c" (administrative contact) and "tech-c" (technical contact) are network contacts, required to be listed by their nic-handles in certain RIPE Database objects. This is done for operational correspondence such as Network troubleshooting. The admin-c must be physically located at the site of the network. The tech-c does not need to be physically located at the site of the network. You can have multiple admin-c, tech-c and zone-c attributes in an object, each of them referencing different person or role objects.\n\n\n# Why has my \'as-name:\' not been accepted?\n\nThe \'as-name:\' should be a short name associated with the Autonomous System (AS). We recommend that the name reflects the name of the organisation that will use the AS Number. The name should be made up of letters, digits, the character underscore "_", and the character hyphen "-"; the first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. The following words are reserved by RPSL, and they can not be used as names: any, as-any, rs-any, peers, and, or, not, atomic, from, to, at, action, accept, announce, except, refine, networks, into, inbound, outbound\n\nNames starting with certain prefixes are reserved for certain object types. Names starting with "as-" are reserved for as set names. Names starting with "rs-" are reserved for route set names. Names starting with "rtrs-" are reserved for router set names. Names starting with "fltr-" are reserved for filter set names. Names starting with "prng-" are reserved for peering set names. Names starting with "irt-" are reserved for irt names.\n\n\n# Can I register a domain name in the RIPE Database?\n\nNo, the RIPE NCC does not register domain names. A decision was made by the RIPE community to remove all forward domain names from the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# How do I register a PERSON or ROLE object in the RIPE Database?\n\nNew RIPE Database users should create a role and maintainer pair. If you already have a maintainer object, you can use webupdates to create a additional objects.\n\nPlease note that person objects registered in the RIPE Database should be referenced from other objects in the RIPE Database, either directly or through a role object. Unreferenced objects will be deleted after 90 days.\n\n\n# Someone has created a person object with my personal details in the RIPE Database. Why did they do this?\n\nSome Internet Service Providers (ISPs) put information about their customers in the RIPE Database. This is usually because you have signed an agreement with the ISP to obtain Internet services from them and given your consent to publish your personal details in the RIPE Database. If you are unhappy with this, please contact your ISP. If you cannot resolve this issue with your ISP, please contact the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# My information in the RIPE Database is not correct, can you please update my object(s)?\n\nThe RIPE Database Terms and Conditions detail who is responsible for maintaining data in the RIPE Database. We suggest you contact the maintainer of the data that is incorrect and ask them to change it. If it is personal data that is incorrect and you are not satisfied with the response from the maintainer, please contact the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# How do I delete an object from the RIPE Database?\n\nIf you query for your object in the RIPE Database web interface, you will see the option to update it in the top right corner.\n\nAfter logging in with your RIPE NCC Access account, you may be required to authenticate against the maintainer that protects the object if it is not yet associated with your account.\n\nYou will then get to the screen where you can modify the object. The "delete" button is in the bottom left corner.\n\nAfter selecting "Delete this object", you will be asked for an optional reason. Once you provide this, the object will be removed from the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# My update failed. Please explain why it failed.\n\nThere are many reasons why an update could fail. Usually, the failure reasons listed in the acknowledgement message you received are self-explanatory. The errors and warnings are contained in the "***ERROR:" and "***WARNING:" lines attached to the object which failed. Please read these lines carefully. Often the errors are simple syntax errors in the object. Check your object for typing mistakes.\n\nAnother common mistake is to query the RIPE Database for an object without using the -B query flag, then submit the returned object in an update. This results in submitting a filtered object, indicated by the line \'source: RIPE # Filtered\' in the query response.\n\nSometimes, your update fails with this error message: "***Error: Authorisation failed". This means that you haven\'t supplied the correct credentials to satisfy the authorisation needed for the maintainer that protects the object. The maintainer is notified of a failed attempt to update this object.\n\nPlease note that if you send several objects in one message and at least one of them fails, the subject of the acknowledgment message will start with "FAILED:". This does not mean that the whole update failed, only that some updates were unsuccessful. Please check the message carefully to see which objects were not updated.\n\n\n# I received a message with the subject "Notification of RIPE Database changes", but I didn\'t do anything and don\'t understand the message. What is it?\n\nThe message you received has been automatically sent to you from the RIPE Database software. The purpose of this notification is to inform you that some objects have been changed in the RIPE Database. You received the message because you were either listed in a "notify:" attribute of the object itself, or in a "mnt-nfy:" attribute of the mntner that protects the object.\n\nIf you did not create or update the object yourself, then someone else did this. The e-mail address from which the update came is usually mentioned in the notification message. Please contact that e-mail address for questions and clarifications about the update.\n\n\n# What are the authorisation rules for route object creation?\n\nRefer to protection of route object space.\n\n\n# Can I download the RIPE Database software?\n\nYes you can download the RIPE database Whois server software from GitHub.\n\n\n# Can I download the RIPE Database?\n\nWe produce daily snapshots which are available to the public. You can find these files at our FTP site or split by object type.\n\nThese daily snapshots exclude the person object type and other personal data is dummified. For data protection reasons, personal data is not available in bulk format.\n\nAnother way to "download" the RIPE Database is to become a Near-Real-Time Mirror (NRTM). This means that you run a copy of the database at your site that keeps up-to-date with the master server by regularly downloading the most recent updates. All personal data is excluded from the NRTM download and updates. For more information, refer to Access to NRTM.\n\n\n# I cannot find any information about a network in the RIPE Database. Can I look somewhere else?\n\nYes: try full text search.\n\n\n# How do I register reverse-delegations in the RIPE Database?\n\nTo register reverse-delegations in the RIPE Database, see Reverse Delegations.\n\n\n# I want to have an IP to country conversion table; can I get it?\n\nThe inetnum object represents IP address space in the RIPE Database; this object has a \'country\' attribute. However, you should not rely on this information to be 100% accurate.\n\nResource holders can also add a "geofeed:" attribute to associate IP addresses to geographic locales. Refer to RFC9092 for more information.\n\n\n# I want to peer with an Autonomous System (AS). How do I do this?\n\nOnce an AS number has been assigned to you, you are responsible for keeping it up to date. It is important that your aut-num object in the RIPE Database reflects reality. If you have new peers and/or stop peering with one or more Autonomous Systems, please update your aut-num object. You update this object in the same way as any other object in the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Can I enter several contacts in one RIPE Database object?\n\nYes. You can have multiple admin-c, tech-c and zone-c attributes in an object, each of them referencing different contact record, person or role objects.\n\n\n# How do I update an object in the RIPE Database?\n\nIf you query for your object in the RIPE Database web interface, you will see the option to update it in the top right corner.\n\nAfter logging in with your RIPE NCC Access account, you may be required to authenticate against the maintainer that protects the object if it is not yet associated with your account. You will then get to the screen where you can modify the object.\n\n\n# Where are the RIR Databases, and what do they contain?\n\nThere are five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Each maintains a database holding details of IP address registrations in their regions. The RIR databases are located at:\n\nAFRINIC (Africa) ARIN (North America, some Caribbean and North Atlantic Islands) APNIC (Asia Pacific region) LACNIC (Southern and Central America and some Caribbean Islands) RIPE NCC (Europe, the Middle East, parts of Central Asia)\n\n\n# Why did I receive an Error 201: Access Denied?\n\nThere are several cases when this might occur. Please see below for the one which applies to your situation:\n\n * You (or your application) performed too many queries that returned contact information (e.g. person or role objects) from the RIPE Database. There is a daily limit on the amount of personal data returned as described in the Acceptable Use Policy.\n * Even if you queried for other types of objects, the associated contact information is returned by default. To avoid this situation please use the -r flag to prevent any associated contact information from being returned.\n * You used a proxy server to access the RIPE Database (such as a third-party web query interface). In this case, it is likely that the proxy itself was denied access to the database. Please contact then administrators of the server you were using and discuss this situation with them. They may need to contact the RIPE Database administration ripe-dbm@ripe.net team to request further access.\n * If none of the above describes your situation, please contact the RIPE Database administration team ripe-dbm@ripe.net to discuss the problem further.\n\n\n# How do I generate glue record for a DOMAIN object?\n\nHere is an example:\n\ndomain: 8.8.8.e164.arpa\ndescr: Example domain for the reserved prefix +888\n[...]\nnserver: ns1.8.8.8.e164.arpa 192.0.2.1\nnserver: ns2.8.8.8.e164.arpa 192.0.2.129\nnserver: ns1.example.net\nnserver: ns2.example.net\n[...]\n\n\nIn this example, the first two "nserver:" attributes contain one glue IP address. THe last two "nserver:" attributes do not need glue, as they are in a different domain - example.net.\n\n\n# How will I know what to fix if the DOMAIN object update failed?\n\nThe responses from our server will include diagnostic messages. You can get further help by sending an email to ripe-dbm@ripe.net.\n\n\n# How long until an update appears in the DNS?\n\nIf you see a message saying that your update was successful, it will be visible in the DNS after around an hour.\n\n\n# Which TTL value is used?\n\nWe will use the default value for the e164.arpa zone. If you need a specific TTL (Time to Live) value, send an email to enum-request@ripe.net.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Glossary\n\n\n# Attribute Continuation Line\n\nWhen an attribute value uses more than one line, the extra lines are continuation lines.\n\n\n# Autonomous System (AS)\n\nA group of IP networks that have a single and clearly defined external routing policy, operated by one or more network operators.\n\n\n# Autonomous System (AS) Number\n\nA unique, numeric value given to an AS. The range of numbers starts at 0 and extends up to a maximum value held by a 32-bit unsigned number 4,294,967,295.\n\n\n# Canonical\n\nStandard or typical. For Ipv6 and DNS, it represents a standard textual representation format.\n\n\n# Child Object\n\nThis object is one level down (more specific) in a hierarchy of INETNUM or INET6NUM objects\n\n\n# Child objects are more specific\n\nBoth IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are structured in hierarchies with 0/0 and ::/0 as the roots of the structures. The root objects have child objects forming the next layer in the hierarchical structure. The root objects are therefore the parents of the child objects. This is repeated throughout the structure as more layers are added. Parent objects are considered to be less specific than the child objects. Child objects are considered to be more specific to the parent objects.\n\n\n# Contact Details\n\nAll details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, email or any other form of electronica communication that is used by a person or an organisation.\n\n\n# Data Contained Therein\n\nA legal phrase referring to information stored in the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Data Controller\n\nA person or organisation that determines the purpose and the manner in which personal data is processed.\n\n\n# Dictionary Attacks\n\nIn computer security, this is a technique for breaking an authorisation mechanism by trying to determine a password, passphrase or an encryption key by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary.\n\n\n# Domain Name\n\nA unique name that identifies an Internet location such as a website.\n\n\n# Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)\n\nThe Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for security certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It is a set of extensions to DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.\n\n\n# Dummification\n\nA process that removes personally identifiable information from the RIPE Database output.\n\n\n# Dummified\n\nWhen all personally identifiable information has been removed from the data.\n\n\n# ENUM\n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocol that maps E.164 telephone numbers to Internet services using the DNS.\n\n\n# Global Resource Service (GRS)\n\nThe RIPE NCC operated mirrors of the others RIR\'s databases as well as some of the major routing registries. Only operational data is stored based on the published statistics of authoritative resources from each RIR. The RIPE Whois service allows this set of mirrors to be queried as a single logical database and returns authoritative responses from the appropriate source.\n\n\n# Glue Record\n\nThe IP address of a name server held at the Domain Name registry. Glue records are required when you wish to set the name servers of a domain name to a hostname under the domain name itself.\n\n\n# Heuristic\n\nUsing experience-based techniques for problem-solving.\n\n\n# Hierarchical Address Space\n\nIndividual IP addresses are \'flat\' addresses. Each address is unique but it does not say anything about where the address is relative to any other address. They are usually allocated and assigned as ranges of addresses. Further sub allocations and assignments can be made from allocations. This builds an administrative hierarchy within the address space, even though the address space itself is not hierarchical.\n\n\n# IANA\n\nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority.\n\n\n# in-addr.arpa\n\nA special domain name used to achieve reverse delegation for IPv4 addresses.\n\n\n# INET(6)NUM\n\nA common abbreviation meaning both INETNUM and INET6NUM objects.\n\n\n# Internet Number Registry (INR)\n\nA registry that allocated Internet number resources and holds and publishes details of Internet number resource information.\n\n\n# Internet Number Resources\n\nGlobally unique address space (IPv4 and IPv6) and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) issued by any Internet Number Registry.\n\n\n# Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)\n\nIPv4 uses 32-bit (four-byte) addresses, which gives a total pool of 4,294,967,296 (2^32) addresses. These addresses are normally represented in a dotted quad notation. An example of an IPv4 address is: 192.0.2.35.\n\n\n# Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)\n\nIPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which gives a total pool of 2^128 addresses. These addresses are normally represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. An example of an IPv6 address is:2001:db8:cd0f:421d:2209:bc:80ba:2095.\n\n\n# Internet Routing Registry (IRR)\n\nA registry that holds and publishes details of Internet routing information.\n\n\n# IP Address\n\nA unique numerical address used to identify a particular piece of hardware connected to the Internet. An IP address services two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.\n\n\n# ip6.arpa\n\nA special domain name used to achieve reverse delegation for IPv6 addresses.\n\n\n# Latin-1\n\nA character set defined by ISO8859-1.\n\n\n# Legacy Resource\n\nInternet number resources that we distributed before (or outside of) the current system of hierarchical distribution by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).\n\n\n# Less Specific\n\nBoth IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are structured in hierarchies with 0/0 and ::/0 as the roots of the structures. The root objects have child objects forming the next layer in the hierarchical structure. The root objects are therefore the parents of the child objects. This is repeated throughout the structure as more layers are added. Parent objects are considered to be less specific than the child objects. Child objects are considered to be more specific to the parent objects.\n\n\n# Maintainer\n\nAny Registrant or person to whom the authority to Update has been delegated by a Registrant either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\n\n# MD5 Password Hash\n\nMD5 is an algorithm for converting a password or passphrase into a hash of characters.\n\n\n# Nested\n\nA series of objects are nested when one references the next, that references the next, and so on.\n\n\n# Network Information Centre (NIC) handle\n\nA sequence of characters that form a unique identifying string used to identify contacts in the RIPE Database (people and business roles).\n\n\n# Object Template\n\nA pattern or guide describing the characteristics of a specific object type.\n\n\n# Object Type\n\nThere are many different RIPE Database objects representing different pieces of information. They are grouped by type, for example a person object type holds contact information for a person.\n\n\n# Overlap\n\nOne address range crosses the boundary of another address range. For example: inetnum: 10.240.89.60 - 10.240.89.67 inetnum: 10.240.89.64 - 10.240.89.79\n\n\n# Parent Object\n\nThis object is one level up (less specific) in a hierarchy of INETNUM or INET6NUM objects.\n\n\n# Parse / Parsing\n\nAnalyse (a string or text) into logical syntactic components, typically in order to test conformance to a logical grammar.\n\n\n# Personally Identifiable Information\n\nA legal phrase that means information that can be used to identify a person.\n\n\n# Prefix\n\nIP address prefixes are patterns which match the first n binary bits of an IP address where n is the prefix.\n\n\n# Prefix Notification\n\nSpecifies ranges using two parts: the starting address and its length (or prefix).\n\n\n# Primary Key\n\nA unique identifier in the RIPE Database within a set of objects of the same type.\n\n\n# Primary Objects\n\nThe set of objects that contain all the operational data in the RIPE Database. All other (secondary) objects are there to support the primary objects.\n\n\n# Pseudo-attribute\n\nAn attribute added to an object, or an update message, that is not part of the RPSL object structure. It is needed for the management of the object(s) in the update message. For example supplying a password for an update using the "password:" pseudo attribute.\n\n\n# Query the RIPE Database\n\nTo request information from the RIPE Database\n\n\n# Range Notation\n\nSpecifies ranges using two parts: the starting address and the end address separated by a hyphen and space characters (\'-\')\n\n\n# Registrant\n\nA natural person or legal entity to whom an Internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other primary object in the RIPE Database by specific or general agreement with the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# Required attribute\n\nThe syntax rules define this attribute as optional. However, additional business rules require this attribute to be present under some circumstances.\n\n\n# Resource Holder\n\nA person or organisation to which an Internet resource has been registered.\n\n\n# Reverse Delegation\n\nAllows mapping to a domain name from an IP address.\n\n\n# RIPE Community\n\nRIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide are IP networks in Europe and beyond. The objective of RIPE is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-European IP network.\n\n\n# RIPE Database\n\nThe publicly available data collection of Internet Number Registry (INR) data, Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data and Reverse Delegation data published by the RIPE NCC. It contains all the primary and secondary objects. There is also some non-public data required for the operation of the RIPE Database and the registries. Its full title is the RIPE Network Management Database. Or sometime it is referred to as the RIPE Whois Database. But for simplicity it is mostly referred to as the RIPE Database. These names are interchangeable and all mean the same thing.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Attribute\n\nThe key name for a formatted element of data in a RIPE Database object. The format may be well defined or free format. An attribute must always have a value associated with it. Unless it is free format, the value cannot be blank. Attributes are sometimes referred to as keys.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Object\n\nA record in the RIPE Database containing information about an Internet resource or some supporting or administrative details.\n\n\n# RIPE Internet Number Registry (RIPE INR)\n\nA registry managed by the RIPE NCC that allocated Internet number resources and holds and publishes details of RIPE resources.\n\n\n# RIPE Internet Routing Registry (RIPE IRR)\n\nA registry managed by the RIPE NCC that holds and publishes details of Internet routing information.\n\n\n# RIPE NCC Service Region\n\nThis defines the geographical area in which the RIPE NCC provides services as an RIR. This includes Europe, the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.\n\n\n# RIPE Policy Development Process (PDP)\n\nThe RIPE community develops and sets policies through a long-established, open, bottom-up process of discussion and consensus-based decision-making.\n\n\n# ROUTE(6)\n\nA common abbreviation meaning both ROUTE and ROUTE6 objects\n\n\n# Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)\n\nAllows a network operator to be able to specify routing policies at various levels in the Internet hierarchy.\n\n\n# Routing Policy System Security (RPSS)\n\nThe Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is used for purposes that have a strong requirements for data integrity and security. The Routing Policy System Security addresses issues of data integrity and security consistent with the usage of the IRR and which avoids compromising data integrity and security.\n\n\n# Secondary Objects\n\nA set of objects that exist in the RIPE Database to support the primary objects.\n\n\n# Uniform Resource identifier (URI)\n\nThe generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the World Wide Web.

It can also be used to describe other types of databases like domain name registries.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# How to Query the RIPE Database\n\nQuerying the RIPE Database is the process of reading information from the database. Historically, this was done from the command line using a whois client. Now, there are a number of ways to query the RIPE Database.\n\nWe describe the general format of a query and the query flags that you can use to change the default behaviour of a query.\n\nWe also describe how the database server automatically tracks query responses and limits how much contact information you can take from the RIPE Database. We do this to reduce the chance that someone will use the database to send spam e-mails to addresses that they find.\n\nFollowing Acceptable use policy, we strive to detect potential attacks. If a DoS attack is detected, we temporarily block the user\'s IP address.\n\nThe RIPE Database Terms and Conditions allow the RIPE NCC to block or suspend access to the RIPE Database services for any suspected abuse. Users exhibiting suspected abusive behavior may be permanently blocked from the system. If a user is permanently blocked, they will receive a notification informing them of the block whenever they attempt to make a query.\n\nIf you wish to be unblocked, please contact the RIPE Database administration team ripe-dbm@ripe.net to discuss further.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Command Line Queries\n\nQueries can be run from almost any computer (connected to the Internet) using standard features built into most operating systems. Some common methods include Netcat, Telnet and a Whois Client.\n\n\n# Netcat\n\nNetcat is a computer networking service for reading from and writing to network connections, using TCP or UDP. Netcat can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. Netcat can often be abbreviated to the command ‘nc\'. This is an example query using netcat.\n\n$ nc whois.ripe.net 43\n% This is the RIPE Database query service.\n% The objects are in RPSL format.\n%\n% The RIPE Database is subject to Terms and Conditions.\n% See http://www.ripe.net/db/support/db-terms-conditions.pdf\n\n-rBGTroute 193.0.7.35\nroute:          193.0.0.0/21\ndescr:          RIPE-NCC\norigin:         AS3333\nmnt-by:         RIPE-NCC-MNT\ncreated:        1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\nlast-modified:  2008-09-10T14:27:53Z\nsource:         RIPE\n\n% This query was served by the RIPE Database Query Service version 1.75 (DB-3)\n\n\n\n# Telnet\n\nTelnet is a network protocol used on the Internet to provide a bidirectional, interactive, text-oriented, communication facility using a virtual, terminal connection.

It is specifically designed to address various shortcomings in WHOIS. It makes use of HTTPS and follows a RESTful (representational state transfer) web services model.\n\n\n# Using RDAP to query the RIPE Database\n\nThe contents of RIPE database can be accessed using RDAP via https://rdap.db.ripe.net/{objectType}/{key} where {objectType} must be one of the object types listed below, and the value of {key} depends on the object type.\n\nList of supported object types\n\nOBJECT TYPE   DESCRIPTION\nautnum        AUT-NUM objects. Example:\n              https://rdap.db.ripe.net/autnum/3333\ndomain        DOMAIN objects. Example:\n              https://rdap.db.ripe.net/domain/193.0.6.139.in-addr.arpa\nip            INETNUM and INET6NUM objects. Example:\n              https://rdap.db.ripe.net/ip/193.0.0.0/21 or\n              https://rdap.db.ripe.net/ip/2001:67c:2e8::/48\nentity        PERSON, ROLE, ORGANISATION and MNTNER objects. Example:\n              https://rdap.db.ripe.net/entity/RIPE-NCC-MNT\n\nFor example, a query for IP information:\n\ncurl -v https://rdap.db.ripe.net/ip/2001:67c:2e8:9::c100:14e6\n\n\nand an example query for domain information:\n\ncurl -v https://rdap.db.ripe.net/domain/193.0.6.139.in-addr.arpa\n\n\nIf the RIPE Database is not authoritative for the requested resource, the response will redirect to the authoritative RIR with a HTTP 301 response status.\n\n\n# Entity Search\n\nThe entities path segment allows searching for matching entities based on a term. The output is an array with objects in RDAP format.\n\nSyntax:\n\nhttps://rdap.db.ripe.net/entities?fn={fn}&handle={handle}\n\n\nWhere:\n\n * fn: Returns all the matches for person:, role:, and org-name: attributes.\n   * Example: https://rdap.db.ripe.net/entities?fn=RIPE-RIPE\n * handle: Returns all the matches for organisation:, nic-hdl: and mntner:(maintainer) attributes.\n   * Example: https://rdap.db.ripe.net/entities?handle=RIPE-RIPE\n\n\n# Domain Search\n\nThe domains path segment allows searching for matches based on a term. The output is an array with objects in RDAP format.\n\nSyntax:\n\nhttps://rdap.db.ripe.net/domains?name={name}\n\n\nWhere:\n\n * name: Returns all the matches for the domain: attribute\n   * Example: https://rdap.db.ripe.net/domains?name=196.46.95.in-addr.arpa\n\n\n# Help\n\nThe help path segment return a valid RDAP object containing the default set of notices for the service.

There are two ways of using the API. One way looks up a specific object and only returns a single object. The other searches for objects matching specified criteria. The search may return large numbers of objects.\n\nThe possible values that you can specify for the Accept/Content-Type header are:\n\n * application/xml for XML\n * application/json for JSON\n * text/plain for TEXT\n\nClients can also append an extension of ".xml", ".json" or ".txt" to the request URL path instead of setting an Accept: header. The server will return a response in the appropriate format for that given extension. XML format is the default one.\n\n\n# REST API Lookup\n\nThis can be done from the command line using a third party software package, from a script or in a browser. It will only return the one specific object requested. For lookups on address space, it will not return the encompassing object if the specified object does not exist. By default objects are filtered as described in Filtering the Query Response.\n\nReturns an object from the RIPE Database.\n\ncurl \'https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/inetnum/193.0.0.0%20-%20193.0.7.255?unfiltered\'\n\n\nAny spaces in the command must be encoded. The response will be returned by default in XML format. Alternatively JSON or text/plain can be returned:\n\ncurl -H \'Accept: application/json\'\n\n\nAdditional resources:\n\n * Version list\n * Version lookup\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Method: GET\n\n\n# URI Format: /{source}/{objectType}/{key}\n\n\n# Path Parameters\n\nNAME         DESCRIPTION\nsource       Source name (RIPE, TEST or a GRS source name).\nobjectType   Type of given object.\nkey          Primary key of the given object.\n\n\n# Query Parameters\n\nNAME          DESCRIPTION\npassword      Password for maintainer authentication (one or more values).\nunfiltered    The returned object should not be filtered ("notify" and\n              "e-mail" attributes will not be removed).\nunformatted   Return the resource in its original formatting (including\n              spaces, end-of-lines).\n\n\n# Headers\n\nNAME            DESCRIPTION\nAuthorization   Basic HTTP Authentication.

To return the unfiltered object specify the unfiltered query parameter. To obtain an unfiltered maintainer object (including all "auth:" attributes), the request must be authenticated.\n\n\n# HTTP status Codes\n\nClient applications should use the HTTP status code to detect the result of an operation. Any error messages will be included in the response body (see below).\n\nPossible reasons for various HTTP status codes are as follows:\n\nCODE                           DESCRIPTION\nOK (200)                       Successful update\nBad request (400)              Incorrect value for object type or key.

The short format is:\n\n-short_query_flag [optional query flag argument]\n\nfor example,  -B dw-ripe\n\n\nThe long format is:\n\n--long_query_flag [optional query flag argument]\n\nfor example, --no-filtering dw-ripe\n\n\nWhen a query includes many query flags, the short and long format options may be mixed. You may list each query flag separately, for example:\n\n-B –i tech-c --no-grouping DW-RIPE\n\n\nYou can also group short query flags together. The long query flags must always be separated. When short flags are grouped, only the last flag in a group may have a flag argument, as in:\n\n-Bi TECH-c --no-grouping dw-RIPE\n\n\nThe query argument is not case-sensitive. As shown in the examples above, it can be in upper case, lower case or a mixed case. Query flags are case-sensitive. This applies to both short- and long-format flags. However, the arguments to the query flags are not case-sensitive. There can be an optional space between a query flag and its argument. However, if the query flag argument is a list, there can be no spaces between elements of the list.\n\n-rBG –Tinetnum,inet6num –imb ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\n\n-rBG –T inetnum,inet6num –i MB ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\n\n\nA list of query flags and query flag arguments are available.\n\nIf you type an IP range you will get an exact match IP range if it exists. Otherwise smallest IP range containing it. (inetnum/inet6num and route/route6 objects).\n\nIf you type a single IP address you will get the smallest IP range containing this IP address. (inetnum/inet6num and route/route6 objects).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Web Query Form\n\nThe web query form is available at: https://apps.db.ripe.net/.\n\nThis is part of the RIPE Database web interface that also includes Webupdates.\n\nThe query argument is entered into the form. Many of the query flags can be selected with check boxes. The database source can also be selected this way. If you know the query flags you want, you can also type them into the form with the query argument.\n\n\n# Using Full Text Search\n\nIf you are looking for a specific piece of information and you don\'t know one of the values required to find what you are looking for, you may consider using the Full Text Search instead of doing a standard query. Full Text Search treats the entire database as a flat text file and allows you to search for anything. The search is done on object text without regard for any relationships. As such, results may be very unstructured, but it can provide a good starting point for more specific standard queries later on. Keep in mind that Full Text Search is only available on the RIPE NCC website and not in other methods to query the RIPE Database.\n\nPersonal data may be returned by the Full Text search API. You may be blocked if excessive amounts of personal data is returned. For more information refer to blocking access section\n\n\n# URI Format: /fulltextsearch/select?...\n\n\n# Query Parameters\n\nNAME             DEFAULT   DESCRIPTION\nq                          This parameter is used to specify the query for requesting\n                           documents.

The Terms and Conditions shall apply to anyone who accesses and uses the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe RIPE NCC is authorised by the RIPE community to act as the registration authority for Internet number resources in its service region and to manage the operation of the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Article 1 - Definitions\n\nIn the Terms and Conditions, the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nRIPE NCC - Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre. A membership association under Dutch law operating its registered office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nRIPE community - RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide area IP networks in Europe and beyond. The objective of RIPE is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-European IP network.\n\nUpdate - submitting information for entry into or removal from the RIPE Database\n\nQuery - requesting information from the RIPE Database\n\nAccess - Update and Query the RIPE Database\n\nInternet number resources - globally unique address space (IPv4 and IPv6) and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) issued by any Internet Number Registry.\n\nPrimary objects - Internet number resources and other data object types that are not directly related to any other primary object type and which are defined by Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) or which have been agreed by the RIPE Community as acceptable primary data.\n\nSecondary objects - objects that are defined by RPSL or which have been agreed by the RIPE Community as acceptable secondary data and which are related, either directly or indirectly, to primary objects.\n\nRIPE Database - the publicly available data collection of Internet Number Registry (INR) and Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data published by the RIPE NCC. It contains all the primary and secondary objects. There is also some non-public data required for the operation of the RIPE Database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the RIPE Database.\n\nRegistrant - a natural person or legal entity to whom an Internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other primary object in the RIPE Database by specific or general agreement with the RIPE NCC.\n\nMaintainer - any Registrant or person to whom the authority to Update has been delegated by a Registrant either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\nUser - anyone who Accesses the RIPE Database. This includes Registrants and Maintainers.\n\nRPSL - Routing Policy Specification Language\n\nInternet Number Registry (INR) - a registry that allocates Internet number resources and holds and publishes details of Internet number resource information.\n\nInternet Routing Registry (IRR) - a registry that holds and publishes details of Internet routing information.\n\nContact details - all details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, e-mail or any other form of electronic communication that is used by a natural person or a legal entity.\n\n\n# Article 2 - General\n\n 1. Access to the RIPE Database is available to anyone provided these Terms and Conditions are followed.\n 2. A User may only Access the RIPE Database and the data contained therein to the extent permitted by these Terms and Conditions. A User who Accesses the RIPE Database agrees to these Terms and Conditions.\n 3. Only Registrants and the RIPE NCC have the authority to Update the RIPE Database. To Update the RIPE Database, a Registrant has to take on the role of a Maintainer or authorise a third party to act as Maintainer on his behalf.\n 4. A Registrant who accepts a registration of an Internet number resource from the RIPE NCC, or who registers any other Primary object in the RIPE Database, or who copies a registration of an Internet number resource from another registry into the RIPE Database, must accept these Terms and Conditions before assuming a Registrant\'s authority to Update the RIPE Database, even if that authority is then delegated to a Maintainer.\n 5. A Maintainer who is not a Registrant must accept these Terms and Conditions before accepting the delegated authority from a Registrant to Update the RIPE Database.\n 6. A Maintainer may only Update the RIPE Database with these types of data:\n    * Internet number resources for which the Registrant holds a valid registration\n    * Primary objects that are not Internet number resources, for which the Registrant has agreement to register\n    * Secondary objects related to either of the above\n 7. A Secondary object must be related to an existing or intended valid Primary object at the time of the Update to create the Secondary object in the RIPE Database. At any time this relationship becomes no longer valid, or the intended relation is never completed, the Secondary object must be deleted. It may be subject to automatic deletion by the RIPE Database management software at any time if it is invalid.\n 8. Registrants and Maintainers will assist the RIPE NCC with security checks and audits as appropriate.\n\n\n# Article 3 - Purpose of the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE Database contains information for the following purposes:\n\n * Ensuring the uniqueness of Internet number resource usage through registration of information related to the resources and Registrants\n * Publishing routing policies by network operators (IRR)\n * Facilitating coordination between network operators (network problem resolution, outage notification etc.)\n * Facilitating network operations by publishing geolocation information about the usage of Internet number resources (including country, region, city of the party to which the resources have been distributed by the Registrants)\n * Provisioning of Reverse Domain Name System (DNS) and ENUM delegations\n * Providing information about the Registrant and Maintainer of Internet number resources when the resources are suspected of being used for unlawful activities, to parties who are authorised under the law to receive such information.\n * Scientific research into network operations and topology\n * Providing information to parties involved in disputes over Internet number resource registrations to parties who are authorised under the law to receive such information.\n\n\n# Article 4 - Use of the RIPE Database\n\n 1. A User may only Access the RIPE Database and the data contained therein for any of the purposes as mentioned in Article 3 hereof and provided these Terms and Conditions are followed.

A User may only conduct queries or submit updates of a nature, rate or volume permitted by the Acceptable Use Policy.\n 3. The RIPE NCC records details about all queries and updates for purposes including detecting and preventing unacceptable use.\n 4. A User may not use the RIPE Database or the data contained therein for advertising, direct marketing, marketing research or similar purposes.\n 5. A User may not re-package, download, compile, re-distribute or re-use any or all of the RIPE Database or the data contained therein unless they do so only with an insubstantial part of the RIPE Database or the data contained therein or when permission to do so is granted by the RIPE NCC.\n 6. A Maintainer can authenticate updates by using a personal or organisation\'s identifier of a type supported by the RIPE Database authentication scheme.\n 7. The RIPE NCC will assume that any action done, or asked for, using that identifier was carried out, or asked for, by the Maintainer who holds that identifier.\n 8. The RIPE NCC may at its sole discretion implement procedures for dealing with lost, cancelled or insecure identifiers.\n\n\n# Article 5 - Control of the RIPE Database\n\n 1. The RIPE NCC may correct or delete RIPE Database data:\n    * according to RIPE policies\n    * to comply with applicable law\n    * if so ordered by any competent court\n    * to fulfill any legal obligation\n    * when a breach of the Terms and Conditions has occurred\n    * for management operations of the RIPE Database\n    * if any data is inaccurate\n    * if any data is entered by someone who is not authorised to do so\n 2. The RIPE NCC may withdraw the service provided hereunder from a User at any time and is entitled, in its sole discretion, to terminate or slow down a User\'s Access to the RIPE Database for any reason, particularly a failure to adhere to the Terms and Conditions.\n 3. The RIPE NCC may suspend Access to the RIPE Database, or part thereof, for maintenance purposes, upgrades, security fixes and deployment of new services subject to notification of the RIPE community.\n 4. The RIPE NCC may, in accordance with the Removal of Personal Data procedure, remove the personal data of an individual upon request by this individual. The RIPE NCC will only take such action when convinced that a valid request from the right person is received.\n\n\n# Article 6 - Responsibilities\n\n 1. The RIPE NCC does not guarantee the accuracy, or completeness or availability of the RIPE Database or of the data contained therein.\n 2. The Maintainer is responsible for keeping all data maintained by them accurate and up-to-date, including correct Contact Details. The data must be good enough to allow the RIPE NCC to contact the Maintainer or Registrant within a reasonable time without having to get information from another source.\n 3. The Maintainer who enters personal data into the RIPE Database has a responsibility to inform the individual to whom the data pertains and to obtain their explicit consent for the entry in the public RIPE Database if required by law.\n 4. The RIPE NCC is not responsible for the use and any issues arising from the use of any registered Internet number resources.\n\n\n# Article 7 - Liability\n\n 1. Use of the RIPE Database and the data contained therein is at the User\'s own risk.\n 2. With the exception of any wilful damage or gross negligence committed by the RIPE NCC or its managerial staff, neither the RIPE NCC nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives who make the RIPE Database available or provide any other service whatsoever to the User, shall be liable to the User or to any third party, including any governmental agency, for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses whatsoever relating directly or indirectly to the use of the RIPE Database, and the User agrees to hold harmless, indemnify and defend the RIPE NCC, its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives for any such claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses, and all costs and expenses that may be incurred in relation to their use of the RIPE Database, including reasonable attorneys\' fees.\n 3. All rights of legal action and other entitlements on the part of the User towards the RIPE NCC in connection with the (use of) the RIPE Database shall lapse as soon as a one year term has expired since the date on which the User has become aware of or could in all fairness have been aware of the existence of such rights and entitlements.\n\n\n# Article 8 - Miscellaneous\n\n 1. If any provision in these Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid in a court of law, this shall not in any way affect the validity of the remaining provisions.\n 2. The User acknowledges and accepts that the Terms and Conditions may be amended by the RIPE NCC. The RIPE NCC will make an announcement at least one month prior to any such amendment coming into effect, unless a more immediate change is required for legal or operational reasons.\n 3. Changes can also be effected through the Policy Development Process.\n\n\n# Article 9 - Intellectual property rights\n\n 1. The User acknowledges that any and all copyright, trade marks, database rights and other intellectual property rights subsisting in or used in connection with the RIPE Database, the data contained therein, the underlying software and any accompanying documents and agreements are and shall remain the property of the RIPE NCC.\n 2.

Copy whois/whois-commons/src/test/resources/whois.properties and whois/whois-commons/src/test/resources/log4j2.xml into whois/tools directory and ensure the following properties are updated to allow running locally, for example have the following:\n   \n   port.query=1043 port.api=1080 port.nrtm=1081\n\nAlso ensure database username and password matches what you have locally. (Normally this should be dbint with no password)\n\n * In Run/Debug configuration Set VM options to:\n   \n   -Dwhois.config=./tools/whois-local.properties -Dhazelcast.config=./tools/hazelcast.xml -Dlog4j.configurationFile=file:./tools/log4j2.xml\n\n * Run mvn clean install -Prelease to ensure property variables set in whois.version.properties is available.\n\n * Start whois by running the Main class net.ripe.db.whois.db.WhoisServer\n\n\n# Importing multiple maven sub-projects under one project\n\nUnlike other IDEs, in IntelliJ you can have only one project. However, you can import multiple projects as modules. If you want to import the whois project with its modules and also another maven project, e.g. whois-related follow the steps:\n\n * From the terminal use mvn clean install to build both projects.\n * Create a new Java project (e.g. root-project) in IntelliJ using the suggested options from the wizard.\n * Select Import module, and navigate to whois project pom.\n * Check the option to import recursively maven projects.\n * Select root-project from the project explorer and repeat step 3 and 4 to import the whois-related project.\n\n\n# Upgrading IntelliJ\n\nIf you upgrade to a newer version of IntelliJ, it will ask you to upgrade your old projects as well.\n\nIf there are problems in the project just remove the IntelliJ files and re-import the projects:\n\n * Quit IntelliJ\n * Go to the projects folder\n * Delete .idea folders and *.iml files\n * Re-import the projects as described above.\n\nIf you want to delete all your IntelliJ project files you can use the following commands:\n\nfind . -iname \'*.iml\' -print0 | xargs -0 rm\nfind . -type d -name \'.idea\' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf\n\n\n\n# Suggested IntelliJ IDE Preferences\n\n * Appearance -> Show tool window bars [on]\n * Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Compile independent modules in parallel [off] (to prevent "Internal AspectJ compiler error")\n * Editor -> General -> Strip spaces on save (All)\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Coding standard\n\nIn general, we follow the standard Java Coding Standard: Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language, with the following additions.\n\n\n# Code Format\n\n * Use modern IDE (import organisation, variable expansion, code generation features are essential). IntelliJ is recommended.\n * Wrap long lines where it makes sense. Disable automatic line wrapping in IDE; break it where you think it improves readability.\n * Don\'t include unnecessary comments, code should be self-documenting. Remember: comments have to be maintained too, but they are not covered by tests.\n * Use readable variable names, which are descriptive of the purpose. Rely on variable name completion of your IDE.\n * Don\'t embed tab characters, expand tabs to 4 spaces. No extra/trailing whitespace.\n * When in doubt, look at existing code & follow conventions.\n * Use explicit imports, not .*\n\n\n# Java Conventions\n\n * Use the final keyword on variables, so they cannot change unexpectedly (no side-effects).\n * Use static imports when it makes sense. E.g. do not use them when there are more than one libraries providing the methods you are importing.\n\n\n# Commits\n\n * You spend hours, days before making a commit. Do spend that 30 seconds to break it into meaningful parts (e.g. using git gui).\n * Commit cosmetic changes separately (e.g. as \'reformatted code\') to make code review easier.\n * Add good explanation as a commit message. Focus on why, not the how.\n * Add warnings where you find necessary (e.g. \'will have to apply sql patch before deployment\').\n\n\n# File Naming Conventions\n\n * Unit Test classes are named <Component>Test.java, located under src/test/java.\n * Java Integration test classes are named <Functionality>TestIntegration.java, also under src/test/java.\n * Groovy Integration tests are named <Functionality>Spec.groovy, under src/test/groovy.\n\n\n# Testing\n\n * Use Hamcrest assertions (ie assertThat(..., is(..)) instead of assertEquals(..,..))\n\n\n# IntelliJ Editor Settings\n\n * Settings / Code Style / Java / Wrapping / Field Annotations = \'do not wrap\'\n * Settings / Code Style / Java / Imports / class count = 999, names count = 999\n\n\n# Git\n\n * Please use "git pull --rebase" to merge remote changes.\n * git config --global pull.rebase true\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Configure MariaDB\n\nInstalling a MariaDB server is useful for development, or for running your own Whois server.\n\n\n# Configuration\n\nSet the following variables in the MariaDB configuration (location varies depending on installation, the configuration file is normally called my.cnf).\n\n\n# Development machine\n\nIf MariaDB was installed through brew on an Apple Silicon machine, new configuration files can be added under /opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf.d/.\n\nAdd the following configuration (e.g. in ripedb.cnf):\n\n[server]\ndefault-time-zone=+00:00\ninnodb_file_per_table = OFF\nmax_connections=1000\n\n\n\n# Running your own Whois server\n\nIf you wish to run your own Whois server, you need additional variables to be modified:\n\n * max_allowed_packet = 20M\n   \n   * We need big packet sizes as some objects are very big\n   * Default is 1M\n   * Ref. https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/server-system-variables/#max_allowed_packet\n\n * innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G\n   \n   * as we only have innodb databases, this should be set to use all the remaining memory available\n   * leave some memory for the OS, and the Whois Java process, and check for swap activity\n   * default is 128MB\n   * Ref. https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size\n\nRestart MariaDB once all configuration changes have been made.\n\n\n# Configure access to the database\n\n * Check if MariaDB is running mysqladmin -u root -p ping\n * Login to MariaDB using mysql -u root -p (or mysql with the default setup)\n * Create users:\n\nCREATE USER \'dbint\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED BY \'\';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO \'dbint\'@\'localhost\';\n\nCREATE USER \'rdonly\'@\'localhost\' IDENTIFIED BY \'\';\nGRANT SELECT PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO \'rdonly\'@\'localhost\';\n\n\nLogout with CTRL+D\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Getting Started on macOS\n\nIt is recommended to use Brew for quick installation of required binaries.\n\n\n# Java\n\n\n# Installation\n\nInstall OpenJDK 17 or higher.\n\n# Using Brew\n\n * Run brew install openjdk\n\n# Manually\n\n * Download and manually install OpenJDK from https://adoptium.net/\n\nMake sure after installation that running java -version reports the correct Java version.\n\n\n# Multiple Java versions\n\nIf you have multiple Java versions installed, ensure that you have $JAVA_HOME set, and that the $PATH contains $JAVA_HOME/bin.\n\n\n# Maven\n\nMaven can be installed through Brew: run brew install maven\n\n\n# Git\n\nGit can be installed via Apple\'s Xcode Command Line Tools or Brew.\n\nIf Brew is installed, Git should already be installed, as it requires Apple\'s Xcode Command Line Tools.\n\n\n# Git Bash completion (optional)\n\nBash can complete Git commands, but it needs additional setup.\n\n# Using Brew\n\nThe Git formulae ships Git\'s bash completion:\n\n * Run brew install git\n\nbash-completion is required for bash completion to work. Depending on which bash is used, a different formulae must be installed:\n\n * For Homebrew\'s bash (>= v4): Run brew install bash-completion@2\n * For macOS\'s bash (v3.2.57): Run brew install bash-completion\n\nRead the formulae\'s caveats for instructions on how to activate bash-completion by adding a line in your .bash_profile.\n\n\n# MariaDB\n\n\n# Installation\n\nThe easiest way of installing MariaDB is through Brew: run brew install mariadb\n\n\n# Configuration\n\nConfigure MariaDB\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Getting started on Ubuntu Linux\n\n\n# Install packages\n\nAs root, install a set of packages already available in the Ubuntu Linux repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get install git maven oracle-java8-jdk mariadb-client-5.5 mariadb-server-5.5\n\n\n# Configure MariaDB\n\nConfigure MariaDB\n\n\n# System\n\nIf at one point you see an error from MariaDB like \'too many open files\' then update /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nsysctl -w kern.maxfiles=1048600\nsysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=1048576\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Installation instructions\n\nIn this section we show how to make a standard setup of whois.\n\n\n# Prerequisite\n\nEnsure MariaDB and the needed databases are created and populated\n\n * See Getting Started on macOS for installation information.\n * See Configure MariaDB for instructions how to create and grant user permission.\n\n\n# Requirements\n\n * A server with 8GB RAM, 8GB swap, and 120GB disk space is recommended to run Whois.\n * Create a role user to run whois server (by default, dbase)\n * Whois root directory, owned by role user\n * MariaDB configured\n * jmxterm-1.0.4-uber.jar, downloadable from the GitHub project linked on http://wiki.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm.\n   * For JDK 17, jmxterm has a problem. As a workaround you can add --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=ALL-UNNAMED to Java for jmxterm to make use of the jconsole module.\n * pgrep\n * /usr/lib/sendmail-compatible mailer, like exim\n\n\n# Setup\n\n * Create a "fat"/shaded jar using mvn clean install -Prelease. If you have issues, check the build page.\n * Copy whois-db/target/whois-db-<version>.jar to whois root directory and rename to whois.jar\n * Copy the files tools/hazelcast.xml, whois-commons/src/test/resources/log4j2.xml from the repo to the whois root directory\n * Copy whois-commons/src/test/resources/whois.properties from the repo to whois root directory and rename to properties\n * Copy downloaded jmxterm jar to the Whois root directory.\n * Adjust properties to match your setup (e.g. JDBC URLs, port numbers, etc...)\n   * for the example below we use port.query=1043 and port.api=1080 and port.nrtm=1081\n * Create the databases WHOIS_LOCAL, MAILUPDATES_LOCAL, ACL_LOCAL, INTERNALS_LOCAL.\n\nCREATE DATABASE WHOIS_LOCAL;\nCREATE DATABASE MAILUPDATES_LOCAL;\nCREATE DATABASE ACL_LOCAL;\nCREATE DATABASE INTERNALS_LOCAL;\nCREATE DATABASE NRTM_LOCAL;\n\n\nExplanation: Firstly connect to mysql server with mysql command and then create database one by one with create database DATABASE_NAME command\n\n * For each of the above databases, run the *_schema.sql scripts found in ./whois/whois-commons/src/main/resources/.\n\nuse WHOIS_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/whois_schema.sql\nuse MAILUPDATES_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/mailupdates_schema.sql\nuse ACL_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/acl_schema.sql\nuse INTERNALS_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/internals_schema.sql\nuse NRTM_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/nrtm_schema.sql\n\n\nExplanation: Select database with command use DATABASE_NAME to be able to run schema on it with command source PATH_TO_SCHEMA\n\n * For the ones that match, run their *_data.sql script equivalents found in ./whois/whois-commons/src/main/resources/.\n\nuse WHOIS_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/whois_data.sql\nuse INTERNALS_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/internals_data.sql\nuse NRTM_LOCAL;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/nrtm_data.sql\n\n\n * Start whois by executing the following command.

Let\'s say that the blocked IP is 192.168.0.1.\n\n  INSERT INTO ACL_LOCAL.acl_limit (prefix, daily_limit, comment, unlimited_connections)\n  VALUES\n  (\'192.168.0.1/32\', -1, \'a comment\', 10000000);\n\n\nAlso make sure there is no other line with the same prefix (192.168.0.1/32) in this table.\n\nAlso run the following, just in case this IP is permanently denied:\n\n  DELETE FROM ACL_LOCAL.acl_denied WHERE prefix = \'192.168.0.1/32\'\n  DELETE FROM ACL_LOCAL.acl_event WHERE prefix = \'192.168.0.1/32\';\n\n\nIf MariaDB says that no row was affected, it is fine.\n\nIf your client has IPv6, use the IPv6/64 prefix.\n\nCommit the changes and in a couple of minutes the Whois server will pick it up and will not block that IP again.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Conventions Used in the RIPE Database Documentation\n\nThe following conventions are used:\n\n * <label> indicates a placeholder or syntax.\n * [option] indicates optional text or command argument.\n * bold font indicates an object type.\n * "attribute:" indicates an attribute of an object.\n * ‘value\' indicates the value of an attribute.\n\nThe term "RIPE Database" is used in several ways depending on the context. It may mean the:\n\n * Entire service\n * Database software\n * Interface\n * Logical database\n * Database contents\n\nWhere there is any doubt, we will clarify what is being discussed.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Intended Audience\n\nThis documentation has been written for both casual and experienced users of the RIPE Database. This documentation assumes a basic knowledge of computing. It also covers more technical aspects for users who wish to run their own local instance of the RIPE Database software.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# RIPE Database Documentation Overview\n\nThis is the starting point for information about the RIPE Database. Everything that you need to know to use the RIPE Database will be described within these pages. If anything is missing or unclear, please contact us and we will do our best to help.\n\nThe format of this documentation is a Master Index with headings and sub-headings. Each of these (sub-)headings links to a separate web page. This web page may be an index page to a series of other web pages. This documentation explains the RIPE Database in a large collection of small documents on specific topics with a comprehensive index so that the information is easy to find.\n\nThere is a Glossary of Terms and Definitions that explains the meaning of commonly used terminology, phrases, words and acronyms related to the RIPE Database. There is also a set of references to other articles, standards and agreements relating to the RIPE Database.\n\nThere is a strong relationship between the full set of documentation and software releases. With every new release, the whole set of documents will be updated to reflect the changes in the software. The previous sets of documentation will still be available to view online or download as a PDF document.\n\nThese documents describe the technical features of the RIPE Database and how to use it. For a full explanation of why the RIPE Database works the way it does you may need to refer to the relevant RIPE Documents.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Notifications\n\nThe RIPE Database returns different types of information to various specified users. When a user submits an update, an acknowledgement (ack) message is returned to that user. This may an email message or via some other HTTP connection. By using any of the notification attributes, notification (notif) messages can be sent to specified users who want to know about certain operations on one or more objects. These notif messages are always sent by email.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Acknowledgment Message\n\nThe acknowledgement (ack) message is always returned to the user who submitted the update to the database, however, the ack message is a unique notification because it is returned via the same method that was used to submit the update. So, for an email update, the ack message is returned to the email address that sent the update. For any other update method, the ack message is returned as an HTTP response.\n\nThe original style of the ack message was designed for an email update response. The same ack message was later used for both Syncupdates and Webupdates. Now Webupdates has a more customised web style of ack message, but Syncupdates still uses the original email ack message style. The RESTful API response is totally different and returns either XML or JSON.\n\nRegardless of the update method, one ack message is returned for each update. The results of all operations on all objects contained in the update are included in the single ack message. For all updates, an ack message that is in the original email style is always generated by the database software. This is logged in the RIPE NCC\'s internal log of database changes, along with copies of all notif messages.\n\n\n# Email Acknowledgement Message\n\nThis ack message holds the overall result of the update, which either ‘FAILED\' or was a total ‘SUCCESS\'. If the update included several objects and the operation on any of those objects failed, then the overall result is ‘FAILED\'. If no individual operation failed, then the overall result is ‘SUCCESS\'. This includes any individual ‘NOOP\' results where no operation was carried out, as the submitted object was identical to the object already in the database. This overall result is stated at the start of the subject line of the ack email sent to the user. Any user comment on the Subject line of the submitted update follows this result.\n\nSubject: SUCCESS: some user comment\nDate:    Thu, 11 Sep 2014 10:42:15 +0200 (CEST)\nFrom:    RIPE Database Administration local <unread@ripe.net>\nTo:      denis@ripe.net\n\n\nThe acknowledgement message content is split into sections. The first section shows from where the update was sent. This could be a copy of the update email header or the IP address for a synchronous connection. This section also includes a summary of the update results, explaining how many objects were recognised by the database software, how many operations were successful and how many failed.\n\nAn example first section of an acknowledgment message would look like this:\n\n>  From:       Denis Walker <denis@ripe.net>\n>  Subject:    some user comment\n>  Date:       Thu, 11 Sep 2014 10:42:14 +0200\n>  Reply-To:   Denis Walker <denis@ripe.net>\n>  Message-ID: <54116066.7030403@ripe.net>\n\nSUMMARY OF UPDATE:\n\nNumber of objects found:                   5\nNumber of objects processed successfully:  4\nCreate:         1\nModify:         2\nDelete:         0\nNo Operation:   1\nNumber of objects processed with errors:   1\nCreate:         0\nModify:         1\nDelete:         0\n\n\nThe next section is the "DETAILED EXPLANATION" of the acknowledgement message. This is split into three parts.\n\n * The first part lists all the objects where the operation failed. This will include "***Error:" messages as well as possible "***Info:" and "***Warning:" messages.\n * The next part shows all the operations that were successful. This may include additional "***Info:" and "***Warning:" messages with each operation listed.\n * The third part lists all the paragraphs from the update message that were not recognised as objects.\n\nEach part is separated in the ACK by a line containing several \'~\' characters. Within each part, the objects and paragraphs are listed in the order that they were processed. This is generally the order that they appear in the update message unless ‘AUTO-n\' NIC Handles are referenced. The line before each object contains three hyphen characters (-) . This allows for easy parsing by script.\n\nBelow is an example of this section of the acknowledgement message:\n\nDETAILED EXPLANATION: \n\n***Warning: Invalid keyword(s) found: some user comment\n***Warning: All keywords were ignored\n\n    \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe following object(s) were found to have ERRORS:      \n\n\n---\nUpdate FAILED: [person] dn1172-ripe          de nis\n***Error: Syntax error in object\n\nperson:          de nis\naddress:         here\nphone:           1\n***Error: Syntax error in "1"\nnic-hdl:          dn1172-ripe\nmnt-by:         TEST-MNT\nsource:          ripe\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe following object(s) were processed SUCCESSFULLY:\n\n\n---\nModify SUCCEEDED: [person] dn1172-ripe          de nis\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe following paragraph(s) do not look like objects\nand were NOT PROCESSED:\n\nThis is a private email.\nIt is intended only for the named recipient.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nThere are many reasons why the operation may fail for an object, including syntax error, authorisation failure and failed business rules check.\n\n~\n\n\n\n# Syncupdates Acknowledgement Message\n\nThere are only two differences between an ack message returned from a Syncupdate update and an ack message returned from an email update. The ‘SUCCESS\' or ‘FAILED\' result shown in the email\'s subject line is now shown as a code in the first line of a Syncupdates response. However, this response code does not provide the same information. An update that fails with an authorisation error will return response code 403. Any other object update failure,or success, will return response code 200. This indicates that the update was successfully processed. It does not mean that all the objects in the update message were successful operations. This must be determined from the numbers of successes and failures in the SUMMARY part of the message output.\n\nIf you use Syncupdates via the web form (see the section \'Syncupdates\') there is no response code. All information has to be interpreted using the content of the ack message.\n\nThe second difference is also in the first section of the ack message. Whereas the email ack message gives details of the received email, the Syncupdates ack message gives details of the IP address sending in the update.\n\n- From-Host: 2001:67c:2e8:13:198e:207d:6a7:47c5\n- Date/Time: Fri Sep 12 11:39:37 2014\n\n\n\n# Webupdates Acknowledgement Message\n\nThe Webupdates ack message is very different to both the email and Syncupdates ack message. Only a single object is allowed in a Webupdates update message. If the update is successful one of the following messages is added to the top of the output:\n\n * Object successfully created\n * Object successfully updated!\n * PERSON object DI1432-RIPE successfully deleted\n\nIf the update fails, the errors are shown in different ways depending on the web format that you are using. If you are using the field format, a general error message may be displayed at the top of the form:\n\n\n\nA specific error will be added, immediately after the attribute that contains the actual error:\n\n\n\nIf it is a general error that does not relate to a specific attribute, but rather to the whole update, this error message will be shown at the top of the output:\n\n\n\nIf you are using the single text area, error messages cannot be added after the attribute that contains the error. Therefore, in this case, all error messages will appear at the top of the output:\n\n\n\n\n# RESTful API Acknowledgement Message\n\nThe ack message for an API update is returned as either an XML or JSON response. The response includes the object that was submitted in the update. If there was an error, an error message section is included at the end of the response. For example an XML error response would include this section:\n\n<errormessages>\n    <errormessage severity="Error" text="Syntax error in %s">\n        <attribute name="phone" value="31 20 535 4444"/>\n        <args value="31 20 535 4444"/>\n    </errormessage>\n</errormessages>\n\n\nFor a creation, using the API, that returns an error message, the output is the same as for an API update. If creation is successful, the version of the object that has been added to the database is returned. This may be different to the version that was submitted in the update if it has any generated attributes.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Notification Messages\n\nThere are a number of attributes that may cause notification (notif) messages to be generated:\n\n * "notify:"\n * "mnt-nfy:"\n * "upd-to:"\n * "irt-nfy:"\n * "ref-nfy:"\n\nWhere there are multiple instances of any notification attribute, all email values will be sent an individual notif message email. Where the notification attribute is contained in a referenced object (for example, in a mntner) and there are multiple references, all the referenced objects will be taken to form a list of email addresses. All these addresses will be sent an individual notif message email. Updates can contain multiple objects. These objects can contain different sets of notification email addresses. Some of the notification email addresses may appear in more than one set. Each email address to be sent a notif message has its own individual message generated that only contains details of the objects that reference that email address. So each notif message that is sent may contain different information.\n\nThere are many attributes related to notifications. These may be contained in many related objects. All the notification attributes can take multiple values and all appropriate email addresses will be used. It is not always obvious why you have received a notification. You can find out why you received a notification by following all references from the object(s) listed in the notification message and looking at the notification attributes that all of these objects contain.\n\n\n# Notification Attributes\n\nThe "notify:" attribute is an optional attribute in all object types. It is used when an object is successfully created or updated. The "notify:" attribute of the old version of the object is used if the object is being modified. If the update fails for any reason then no notifications will be sent to any "notify:" email addresses.\n\nThe optional "mnt-nfy:" and mandatory "upd-to:" attributes can only be included in mntner objects.\n\nWhen a maintained object is updated successfully, a notification message will be sent to email addresses contained in all "mnt-nfy:" attributes of all mntner objects that are referenced by the updated object.\n\nSometimes an update fails one or more of the required authentications. This is considered a security issue. It could mean that someone is attempting to gain control of or change your data. In this case, notifications are sent to all the email addresses contained in all the "upd-to:" attributes of all the mntner objects that are referenced by the object in the update. This is sometimes the only attribute holding an email address that is associated with an object. The RIPE NCC may occasionally use this email address to contact someone related to an object in the RIPE Database for any security-related issue. More general issues may also be raised addressed using this email address if this is the only contact point for an object.\n\nThe optional "irt-nfy:" attribute is only allowed in an irt object. This is used when a reference to an irt object is added to, or removed from, an inetnum or inet6num object (by means of the "mnt-irt:" attribute).\n\nThe optional "ref-nfy:" attribute is only allowed in an organisation object. This is used when a reference to an organisation object is added to an object (using the "org:" attribute).\n\n\n# Format of the Notification Message\n\nThe format of a notification message is similar to the ack message for an email update. The first section of the message explains why you are being sent this notification. The next section of the notification message has the email header or IP address details showing where the update came from. The final section shows the changes that were contained in the update message, if it was successful. For a creation it shows the newly created object. For a deletion, it shows the object that was deleted. For a modification, it shows the new version of the object. In this case, a ‘diff\' is also included to show the difference between the original object and the new object. If the modification update failed, the current version of the object is shown and the diff shows the change that was being attempted.\n\nIf using passwords in an update message, be cautious when entering this. If you mistype the password pseudo-attribute (eg "password: clear_password") the notification will include your clear text password.\n\nThe "upd-to:" attribute in a MNTNER object should only include the email address of a person or team in your organisation who deals with security issues. If this team receives a notification containing a clear text password, they should advise the user to change their password.\n\nEach notification message is only sent to a single email address. There is no email address copied (via CC) in any notification. When multiple email addresses need to be notified of the same update, each address will receive its own email. This email will contain all notification details of objects that are contained in the update message that relates to that email address. For an update with multiple objects, referencing several mntner objects, where several objects have a variety of notification attributes, the software builds a matrix of email addresses and updated objects. This ensures that only the appropriate details are sent to each email address.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Related Software and Tools\n\n\n# RIPE Database Tools\n\nThe RIPE Database is a BSD licensed open source project on Github. You can read, verify and contribute to the source code. If you find a bug in the RIPE Database, please ket us know. On this page you can find an overview of all tools to help you manage your RIPE Database objects.\n\n\n# Reset a lost MD5 maintainer password\n\nIf you lost your MD5 password, you can use this form to request a reset. It requires you to log in with your RIPE NCC Access (SSO) account, which you can create if you don\'t have one yet. If possible, the process should be completely automated, but in some cases it may require intervention from a Customer Services representative. Please note that our policy is to replace a lost MD5 password with a RIPE NCC Access (SSO) account, as this is more secure and allows you to reset a lost password seamlessly in the future.\n\n\n# My Resources\n\nMy Resources offers an overview of all IPv4, IPv6 and ASN resources you hold or sponsor at a glance. It displays allocation usage, as well as an overview of all more specific ranges that have been created under each allocation. An inline editor allows for intuitive updates.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Geolocation in the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE NCC is not a geolocation provider. Following a unanimous decision by the RIPE NCC Executive Board not to support resource expenditure in the area of geolocation services, the RIPE NCC has no plans to become a provider.\n\nA number of companies provide geolocation services, including:\n\n * Abstract\n * apiip\n * Bigdatacloud.com\n * Fastah™ API on AWS Marketplace and Azure Marketplace\n * GeoIP® by MaxMind\n * Live Geoip\n * IP2Location\n * ipapi by Kloudend\n * ipapi.is\n * ipdata.co\n * ipgeolocation.io\n * IPinfo.io\n * Ipregistry\n * IPWHOIS.IO\n * Neustar\n\nIf you are a geolocation provider and would like to be added to this list, please contact us.\n\nThe RIPE Database offers the "geoloc:" attribute on ORGANISATION and INET(6)NUM objects that may or may not be used as an additional source of information by these providers.\n\nIf you want to update the geolocation on your inet(6)num object you can do so using webupdates. Just search for your object and update it. To add a "geoloc:" attribute, click the "+" icon and select the "geoloc:" attribute. The value can be entered as two floating point numbers if you know the longitude and latitude. Please be aware that this information may not be picked up by geolocation providers.\n\nIf you want to find the geolocation of an IP Resource, you can use the RIPEstat geolocation widget.\n\nPlease be aware that geolocation information is added by the resource holders in the RIPE Database and the RIPE NCC does not verify this information.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release Notes\n\nThis page will be updated with every release of the RIPE Database software. The version number of the production software is visible at the end of each query as a comment and is also presented at the end of each update acknowledgement.\n\nYou can test an upcoming Release Candidate (RC) in the Release Candidate environment\n\nUpcoming Release\n\nCurrent Release\n\n * RIPE Database Release 1.115.1\n\nPrevious Releases\n\n * RIPE Database Release 1.115\n * RIPE Database Release 1.114\n * RIPE Database Release 1.113.2\n * RIPE Database Release 1.113.1\n * RIPE Database Release 1.113\n * RIPE Database Release 1.112.1\n * RIPE Database Release 1.112\n * RIPE Database Release 1.111\n * RIPE Database Release 1.110\n * RIPE Database Release 1.109.1\n * RIPE Database Release 1.109\n * RIPE Database Release 1.108\n * RIPE Database Release 1.107\n * RIPE Database Release 1.106.1\n * RIPE Database Release 1.106\n * RIPE Database Release 1.105\n * RIPE Database Release 1.104\n * RIPE Database Release 1.103\n * RIPE Database Release 1.102.3\n * RIPE Database Release 1.102.2\n * RIPE Database Release 1.102.1\n * RIPE Database Release 1.102\n * RIPE Database Release 1.101\n * RIPE Database Release 1.100\n\nArchive of Older Releases\n\n\n# Release Candidate Environment\n\nThe Release Candidate environment contains the upcoming release of the database software with a dummified snapshot of the production data. The dummification is only applied to personal data. This environment makes it possible for you to test your software with upcoming versions of the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Information About Services\n\nSERVICE           LOCATION\ncommand line      whois-rc.ripe.net, port 43\nsyncupdates       https://syncupdates-rc.db.ripe.net\nREST API          https://rest-rc.db.ripe.net\nRDAP API          https://rdap-rc.db.ripe.net\nweb application   https://rc.db.ripe.net\nmailupdates       rc-dbm@ripe.net\n\n\n# Differences From Live RIPE Database\n\n * For each mntner object in the Release Candidate database, the passwords have been set to the object id. For example, the object:\n\ninetnum: 193.0.0.0 - 103.0.7.255 ... mnt-by: ninja-mnt ... can be changed by supplying the password: ninja-mnt. Regardless of the passwords used in the live RIPE Database, in the Release Candidate database they have been adjusted to reflect the mntner id.\n\n * The databases are snapshots of live RIPE Database data, dummified in the beginning of each new testing period. Personal data is replaced during the dummification process.\n * No emails are sent from the Release Candidate system. This means no response from mailupdates submissions to the Release Candidate database, no ack or notify emails are sent by the Release Candidate database.\n\n\n# Notes\n\nAs in the live RIPE Database, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are active. Even though the personal data in the Release Candidate database is dummified, ACLs are active to ensure it operates in the same way as the production system.\n\nEven though the Release Candidate database contains snapshot of the live data from the start of the testing period, no changes made to the Release Candidate database will have any impact on the live RIPE Database data. The two are completely separated.\n\nAny scripts or automated processes you use to maintain your data in the RIPE Database can be used with the Release Candidate database - simple adjust the URLs accordingly. The whole purpose is to allow you to test your processes as closely as possible to the action RIPE Database using newly developed and released software.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.100\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 8 April 2021 Production environment: 22 April 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.100 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Separate email address and leading/trailing space during Punycode conversion (#782)\n * Use status index during update validation (#725)\n * Fixed aut-num attribute managed flag in lookup and search response (#749)\n * Added client flag to API for proxying requests (#728)\n * RDAP nameserver not implemented (#711)\n * Fixed delete object bug (#723)\n * Java 11 support (#673)\n * Update dependencies\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.101\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 17 June 2021 Production environment: 1 July 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.101 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Switch RIPE database to UTC timezone\n * Display an error on NRTM if client is blocked by ACL limit (#812)\n * Added rewrite rules to embedded jetty (#801)\n * RDAP nameserver queries always return Not Implemented (#811)\n * Updated dependencies\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# Operational Changes\n\nSome operational changes will also de made to the production environment on 1 July 2021:\n\n * Remove support for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 on HTTPS connections\n   * The IETF has formally deprecated these TLS versions, now only version 1.2 and 1.3 are recommended.\n * Remove unsecure TLS cipher algorithms\n   * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n   * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SH\n * Remove HTTP redirects for whois.ripe.net and www.db.ripe.net\n   * HTTP requests to these hosts will no longer redirect to https://apps.db.ripe.net but will return 400 Bad Request.\n * Remove HTTP redirects for the legacy Whois REST API\n   * The legacy Whois REST API was retired in 2015, a temporary redirect is now being removed.\n   * HTTP requests to http://apps.db.ripe.net/whois/lookup/ripe will return 400 Bad Request.\n\nPlease check your Whois client in case you are affected by these changes.\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 23 November 2021 Production environment: 7 December 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102 includes the following main changes:\n\n * NWI-13: Geofeed (#937)\n * Support base64 encoded signed update messages (sent by Thunderbird 78+)(#942)\n * Updated "geoloc:" help text (#929)\n * Support IDN in outgoing mail update notifications (#888)\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102.1\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 13 December 2021 Production environment: 13 December 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102.1 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Updated Log4j to 2.15.0 to fix the Log4Shell vulnerability: https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102.2\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 20 December 2021 Production environment: 20 December 2021\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102.2 includes the following main change:\n\n * Update the Log4j library from 2.15.0 to 2.17.0 to fix vulnerabilities\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.102.3\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 31 March 2022 Production environment: 31 March 2022\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.102.3 includes the following main change:\n\n * Update of the Spring Framework library from 5.3.13 to 5.3.18 to address Spring4Shell vulnerability.\n\nThe full list of changes can be found in the source repository: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/whois/blob/master/changes.txt\n\n\n# RIPE Database Release 1.103\n\n\n# Date of Deployment\n\nRelease Candidate (RC) environment: 25 April 2022 Production environment: 9 May 2022\n\n\n# New or Improved Features\n\nWhois Release 1.103 includes the following main changes:\n\n * Fixed "geofeed:" validation when reading object containing multiple remarks: attributes (#975)\n * Removed WHITEPAGES org type.

Many of the operational responsibilities for data handling are delegated to the individuals who have mntner objects in the database. These individuals, or Maintainers, maintain sets of data related to their IP network operations.\n\nIf one of these Maintainers fails to fulfill their Data Protection responsibilities, the RIPE NCC could have a legal obligation to intervene. This may require the RIPE NCC to modify or delete personal Contact Details. The procedure outlined in this document balances maintaining accountability with the privacy rights of individuals.\n\n\n# Definitions\n\nIn this document, the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nRIPE NCC – Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre. A membership association under Dutch law operating its registered office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nRIPE Community – RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide area IP networks in Europe and beyond. The objective of RIPE is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-European IP network.\n\nUpdate – submitting information for entry into or removal from the RIPE Database.\n\nInternet number resource – globally unique address space (IPv4 and IPv6) and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) issued by any Internet Number Registry.\n\nPrimary objects – Internet number resources and other data object types that are not directly related to any other Primary object type and which are defined by Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) or which have been agreed by the RIPE Community as acceptable primary data.\n\nRIPE Database – the publicly available data collection of Internet Number Registry (INR) and Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data published by the RIPE NCC. It contains all the Primary and Secondary objects. There is also some non-public data required for the operation of the RIPE Database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the RIPE Database.\n\nRegistrant – a natural person or legal entity to whom an Internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other Primary object in the RIPE Database by specific or general agreement with the RIPE NCC.\n\nMaintainer – any Registrant or person to whom the authority to Update has been delegated by a Registrant, either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\nEnd User – a person for whom an Internet number resource has been registered for their use.\n\nData Subject – a natural person whose personal Contact Details or other personal data are recorded in the RIPE Database.\n\nContact Details – all details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, e-mail or any other form of electronic communication that is used by a natural person or a legal entity.\n\nPersonal Contact Details – Contact Details pertaining to a natural person.\n\nInternet Registry – Any registry that makes Internet number resources available to other people and records information in a database about the Registrant.\n\n\n# General\n\nPersonal Contact Details are held in several object types (see Appendix G) The person object is the starting point for all data sets in the RIPE Database and this procedure will focus on these objects.\n\nChanges to Personal Contact Details can have significant consequences. To change or remove Personal Contact Details may require:\n\n * References to be removed from other objects.\n * Some other objects to be deleted.\n * Internet number resources to be returned to the appropriate Internet Registry.\n * Registrant/Maintainer to lose control and/or right of usage of the Internet number resource.\n\nThe precise course of action depends on the type of object in which the person object is referenced. The RIPE NCC has a legal obligation to remove Personal Contact Details on request from the Data Subject in some situations.\n\nIf the Data Subject is the Registrant of an Internet number resource and wishes to remain the Registrant of that resource, the following options are available:\n\n * Insert Personal Contact Details for some other person from the Data Subject’s organisation.\n * Insert Contact Details related to the Maintainer of the resource if this is not the Data Subject. This option is only available if the Maintainer agrees or if the Maintainer is also the Registrant.\n * Insert Contact Details related to the organisation responsible for the parent resource (provided that this is not the RIPE NCC). In this case, responsibility for maintaining the data should also pass to this parent resource organisation if they are not already the Maintainer. This option is only available if the parent resource organisation agrees.\n * Deny the request to remove Personal Contact Details if the Data Subject is the Registrant and does not wish to return the Internet number resource, or the Data Subject is the Maintainer and does not wish to release control over the resource and none of the above options are available.\n\nThe Data Subject needs to be aware of the consequences of removing Personal Contact Details where the options above are not possible or acceptable. The Data Subject cannot maintain an Internet number resource and be anonymous. Where accountability for registrations of global resources conflicts with an individual’s right to privacy, drastic action may be required. This may involve returning Internet number resources to the Internet Registry that issued them and removing all associated data from the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# Procedure\n\nThe RIPE NCC has tried to clearly identify a series of steps that can be taken at different stages. The aim is to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all parties and protect everyone’s interests while maintaining the RIPE NCC’s responsibility as a public registry of Internet number resources. The RIPE NCC will always inform the Data Subject within four weeks in writing whether a request for change or removal of Personal Contact Details will be granted. If the request is denied, the RIPE NCC will duly motivate this decision. This procedure refers only to person objects for clarity, but other objects may be involved (see Appendix G).\n\nThe steps that will be taken are as follows:\n\n 1. The RIPE NCC is contacted by a Data Subject asking for their Personal Contact Details to be removed from the RIPE Database. The Data Subject must clearly identify the details they are referring to by sending a copy of the Personal Contact Details to the RIPE NCC.\n 2. The RIPE NCC forwards the request to the Maintainer of the person object and copies the Data Subject on the\n    e-mail. The Maintainer is asked to resolve the issue within ten working days and send confirmation to both the RIPE NCC and the Data Subject.\n 3. a. If the RIPE NCC receives confirmation from the Maintainer that action has been taken, the RIPE NCC notifies both the Maintainer and the Data Subject that the case is closed.\n    b. If no confirmation is received from the Maintainer, but the person object has been deleted or substantially changed, the RIPE NCC notifies both the Maintainer and the Data Subject that the issue has been resolved and the case is closed.\n    c. If no confirmation is received from the Maintainer, and nothing has changed, the RIPE NCC contacts the Data Subject and copies the message to the Maintainer. The Data Subject is asked to confirm that they still want the personal Contact Details removed. If they confirm this, the RIPE NCC moves to Step 4 (below).\n\nThe following steps are the actions the RIPE NCC will take when the Maintainer does not respond to or does not comply with the request to change or remove Contact Details:\n\n 4. The RIPE NCC asks the Data Subject for a copy of a legal identification document. This document must match the personal Contact Details to be removed. This should be faxed to the RIPE NCC together with a formal request for the removal of the personal Contact Details.\n 5. The RIPE NCC receives the signed request and identification document from the Data Subject.\n 6. If it is a simple case where:\n    * The person object is unreferenced.\n    * Each object referencing the person object references more than one person object.\n 7. For a simple case, the RIPE NCC sends an acknowledgement to the Data Subject and the Maintainer informing them that the personal Contact Details have been removed and the case is closed.\n\nFor anything other than one of the simple cases, the RIPE NCC continues with the following steps:\n\n 8.  The RIPE NCC sends a statement to the Data Subject of actions to be taken, which includes a list of any other data that may be affected which is directly related to the person object and the changes that need to be made to this data. This list will highlight any resources that will need to be returned to an Internet Registry or transferred to another Maintainer and the possible consequences of this action. These consequences may include the removal of some data from the RIPE Database.\n\n 9.  Because of the referential integrity rules, when any data is removed from the RIPE Database, there can be a chain reaction. This may result in more data being changed or removed. The Maintainers of any such data will be informed and requested to make the appropriate changes. These changes will have to be made before the Data Subject\'s details can be removed because no object can be deleted from the RIPE Database while it is still referenced.\n\n 10. If there is an option for data to be transferred to another Maintainer but the latter Maintainer is not willing to be the Maintainer of this data, then there are only two options available:\n     \n     * The User must return the resource to the appropriate Internet registry and their personal Contact Details will be removed.\n     * The User’s personal Contact Details cannot be removed but can be corrected if there is an error.\n     \n     In the former case, if the Data Subject confirms the action, the RIPE NCC moves into the clean-up phase. In the latter case, any corrections will be applied and the case is closed.\n\n 11. a. If the Data Subject confirms the action in the statement, the RIPE NCC moves into the clean-up phase.\n     b. If the Data Subject does not confirm this action, no further action is possible and the case is closed.\n\n\n# Clean-up Phase\n\nThis is the procedure taken by the RIPE NCC when the removal of personal Contact Details is not a simple case. The actual implementation is very technical and requires some recursive searching for references.\n\nThe goal is to remove the person object containing the Data Subject’s personal Contact Details. All reference chains must be followed and appropriate changes made as close in the chain as possible to the person object to maintain the referential integrity of the RIPE Database.\n\nIf an object needs to be deleted, special considerations may apply, depending on the object type (see Appendix F). This may involve returning some resources to the appropriate Internet Registries. If these resources are registered to the Data Subject requesting the removal of personal Contact Details, the resources will be listed in the statement to the Data Subject together with the consequences. If the resources are managed by other Maintainers, the Maintainers will be notified and given an opportunity to change the references and take their resources off the list of affected objects. This must be done before the Data Subject’s personal Contact Details can be removed.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt is easier for all concerned if the Maintainers make any necessary changes to the personal Contact Details. The Maintainers are closer to the people involved and have a better understanding of how to replace references to the Data Subject. If the RIPE NCC has to make changes it is because the Maintainer of the data has not responded in a timely manner. In this case, the drastic actions detailed in this procedure, including requiring resources to be returned, are necessary.\n\nBecause the procedure requires drastic actions in some cases, it is important that the RIPE NCC can contact the right people to inform them of the actions in advance. Currently, the RIPE NCC has no authoritative contact details for the Maintainer of many sets of data objects. The RIPE NCC only has the set of e-mail addresses listed in the objects in the RIPE Database. Few of these have been verified and some may prove to be invalid. The RIPE NCC will consider the Maintainer to have been informed by sending an e-mail to the address listed in the RIPE Database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# RIPE Database Acceptable Use Policy\n\n\n# Definitions\n\nIn the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nRIPE NCC – Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre. A membership association under Dutch law operating its registered office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nUpdate – submitting information for entry into or removal from the RIPE Database\n\nQuery – requesting information from the RIPE Database Access – Update and Query the RIPE Database\n\nRIPE Database – the publicly available data collection of Internet Number Registry (INR) and Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data published by the RIPE NCC. It contains all the primary and secondary objects. There is also some non-public data required for the operation of the RIPE Database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the RIPE Database.\n\nUser – anyone who Accesses the RIPE Database or causes Access to be made. This includes Registrants and Maintainers, as defined in the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions.\n\nAbuse-c – an attribute referencing a role object holding abuse contact information, to be included in inetnum, inet6num and aut-num objects, intended for receiving automatic and manual reports about abusive behaviour originating in resource holder\'s networks.\n\nSSO Account – the RIPE NCC access (Single Sign-On) account Users can access RIPE NCC services through.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe following principles define the purpose of this policy. Without prejudice to the applicability of the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions, this policy is to ensure that:\n\n * The usage of the RIPE Database is in line with the purpose of the RIPE Database as defined in the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions.\n * No copy of a significant part of the RIPE Database is made without the consent of the RIPE NCC.\n * We protect the personal data held within the RIPE Database. The RIPE Database service is only used as intended and defined in documents and manuals associated with the service.\n * All Users comply with the limits set on their Access to the RIPE Database services.\n * We do not put the RIPE Database services at risk.\n * Our general policies (e.g., on pricing, fees, privacy, data protection and Access) are not compromised.\n * Users do not act in a way that disrupts the RIPE Database services for other Users.\n\nThe RIPE Database Terms and Conditions permit the RIPE NCC to block Access to the RIPE Database services by any User for abuse, or suspend Access for suspected abuse.\n\nPlease note that we have a standard clause on anti-avoidance and connected persons that forms part of this policy (see below).\n\nWe may reject queries originated by Users who have exceeded their limit or who are subject to sanctions for abuse without regard to their limit.\n\n\n# Limits\n\nThese are the limits currently set by the RIPE NCC for using the RIPE Database services.\n\nQuery service\n\n * Number of queries from an IP address – Unlimited [1]\n * Number of queries passed by a proxy – Unlimited [1]\n * Number of personal data sets returned in queries from an IP address – 1,000 per 24 hours [3][4]\n * Number of personal data sets returned in queries from a proxy IP address – 20,000 per 24 hours [3][4]\n * Number of personal data sets returned in queries from an SSO Account – 1,000 per 24 hours [3][4]\n\nUpdate service\n\n * Number of update e-mails sent to auto-dbm@ripe.net – Unlimited [1]\n * Number of updates submitted through the syncupdates interface – Unlimited [1]\n * Number of updates submitted through the webupdates interface – Unlimited [1]\n * Number of objects contained in a single update message – 5,000\n * Size of a single update message – 500Kb\n * Number of queued e-mail update messages from any one e-mail address – 100\n\nGeneral\n\n * Number of simultaneous connections to the RIPE Database server – 3 [2]\n\n\n# Anti-avoidance and Connected Persons\n\nOne way that the principles of this policy can be compromised is if Users try to give the impression that they are separate, or claim to be separate, when in fact they are acting together to pool their limits, for example. If the RIPE NCC believes Users are acting in a coordinated way to bypass the above limits, we will consider the situation and act on a case-by-case basis. References\n\n\n# References\n\n[1] Where no limits are set, or a limit is set as Unlimited, we work on the basis of reasonable use. This means that we expect Users not to do anything that could abuse or damage the RIPE Database service or cause service disruption for other Users. If we detect any User causing problems we may, at our sole discretion, slow down or temporarily or permanently block Access to the RIPE Database services for that User.\n\n[2] Queries can be sent to the RIPE Database without the need to wait for the previous query to return.\n\n[3] If the number of personal data sets limit is exceeded, the User will be temporarily blocked from making any queries to the RIPE Database from the IP address, or SSO Account, submitting the queries for personal data. The number of queries accepted from the temporarily blocked IP address or SSO Account will recover exponentially over time. This will allow a slower query rate for some time. However, if a User is temporarily blocked several times, or continues to submit queries excessively even while blocked, they will be permanently blocked from querying the RIPE Database from that IP address or SSO Account, as the case may be. Despite the set limits for queries by the RIPE Database User, the email contacts which are included in the ”abuse-c” attribute are meant to be available with no restrictions to bulk access. Because this attribute can potentially be filled in with email addresses that could be considered to be personal, it is the maintainer\'s responsibility to inform the individual whose personal details will be referenced in the RIPE Database and obtain their consent for use of their data.\n\n[4] Queries which are made to the RIPE Database by a User logged into their SSO Account will be accounted for separately from the IP address of that User. This means that if a User is logged in to their SSO Account, any query for objects containing personal data will be counted against their SSO Account and not their IP address. If a User is not logged into their SSO Account any queries for objects containing personal data will be counted against their IP address.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Access to NRTM\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis document describes show to access a RIPE Near Real Time Mirror (NRTM) Database data stream from the RIPE NCC.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nNear Real Time Mirroring (NRTM) is a mechanism that allows any client to receive a stream of available data from a database on a server operated by the RIPE NCC. The client can receive this stream of data modification from the server in near real time. The server will determine what data is made available to the client. Some data will be excluded from the stream or modified before sending. This is described below. The client pulls available data from the server by submitting requests. These requests can be periodic or continuous. The client can be initialised to a known state and the data stream can then be requested to continue with updates from that point onwards. However, updates are only available from the server as a data stream for two weeks. If the client has requested no updates for this period, then the client will need to be reinitialised.\n\nThe NRTM database made available by the RIPE NCC does not include any custom software or proprietary database engine with which to utilise the data.\n\nNOTE that it is not possible for users to mirror any of the RIPE NCC mirrored databases (for instance, other RIR databases). If you need a NRTM data stream from any other source you must contact that source directly.\n\n\n# NRTM Protocols\n\nCurrently there are two versions of the NRTM protocols available, Version 2 and Version 3. There is backwards compatibility between the two versions.\n\nThe RIPE Database server generates a serial number every time it processes an update in the database. When generating these serial numbers, the server describes all modifications to the database in terms of two atomic operations: deletion and addition.\n\nVersion 2 sends some data from every serial in the data stream. Where the real data is excluded, dummy data must be sent to maintain the sequence of serials.\n\nVersion 3 adds the serial number after the operation command for each update in the data stream. This eliminates the need to send dummy objects to keep serials in sync.\n\nCurrently, either version can be used. It is possible to switch between the versions. We would recommend using version 3. This allows you to process a more condensed data stream, leading to a cleaner database without the clutter of excessive dummy objects.\n\n\n# Excluded Data\n\nThe RIPE NRTM Database made available by this service does not include the full set of data contained in the RIPE Database. It specifically excludes:\n\n * Personal data (person and role objects)\n * Organisation details (organisation object)\n * Security data (mntner object)\n * References to personal data (NIC Handles)\n\nFor both Version 2 and 3 of the NRTM protocol the mntner and organisation objects are replaced in the data stream by dummy data. These are placeholder objects. They still contain the primary key and other objects make references to these objects.\n\nIn Version 2 of the NRTM protocol, the person and role objects are also replaced in the data stream by dummy data. However, the same dummy person object replaces all person and role objects. All references in other objects to person and role objects will refer to this single dummy person object.\n\nIn Version 3 of the NRTM protocol, the person and role objects are completely omitted from the data stream. Because the serials are included with each object in the data stream, it is not necessary to maintain placeholders.\n\nIf a client is blocked from Whois for excessive querying of personal data, they will also be blocked from NRTM.\n\n\n# Initial Setup\n\nAn initial data set is available from our ftp site. It is available in two formats:\n\n * Individual data files\n * Single data file\n\nThe individual data files contain data for each object type in separate text files. The excluded data (described above) is not available from these files. The set of files can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/split\n\nAll the data from the "optional" attributes has been removed from the files for the organisation and mntner objects. All of the data from the "mandatory" attributes has been replaced with standard dummy data, except for the primary key value. So, for a mntner object, only the "mntner:" attribute will contain any real data. The files for person and role objects contain only a single dummy person object with the NIC Handle \'DUMY-RIPE\'.\n\nThe single file is a merged data set of all the individual data files in a single text file. It contains the excluded organisation and mntner objects as dummy objects and a single person and role dummy object. This can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.db.gz\n\nAll of these files are produced on a daily basis. Only the most recent file is available from the dtp site. Each database update has a serial number and these serials define the data pulled from an NRTM data stream. The latest update serial included in the data files is held in a separate text file on the FTP site: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/RIPE.CURRENTSERIAL\n\nYou will need this serial number to know which serial to start pulling from the NRTM data stream. Note that only update serials from the previous 14 days can be pulled from the RIPE NRTM Database server. If you have not pulled any data from the NRTM stream for more than 14 days, you will need to download the above text files again, reinitialise your database and start from the new serial number. You may want to keep track of the serials that you pull from the NRTM data stream. If you have any gaps that are older than 14 days, then you will need to download all the text files again.\n\n\n# Accessing the Data Stream\n\nTo receive data from the NRTM data stream you must first connect to the host server and then pull selected data from it.\n\nThe client must connect to the host whois.ripe.net at port 4444.\n\nWhen sending data to a client using the Version 2 protocol, the server will send one of two strings ("ADD" or "DEL") followed by two line-break characters (\\n\\n) and then the corresponding object. This will either be the object as it was before deletion or the object as it should appear after being created or modified. If an object already existing in the database follows the "ADD" string, the client software should treat this as a modification.\n\nWith the Version 3 protocol the serial follows the operation string ("ADD" or "DEL") on the same line. All other returned data is the same as for Version 2.\n\nAfter connecting to the server, the client can request data by using the -g query flag. The arguments to this query flag are: -g <source> :<NRTM_Protocol_version_#>:<first>-<last>\n\nwhere\n\n * <source> is the string that identifies the server database that is being mirrored (only RIPE is available).\n * <NRTM_protocol_version_#> is the version of the mirroring protocol that the <source> supports (this should be 2 or 3 for the source RIPE).\n * <first> is the lowest serial number requested.\n * <last> is the most recent serial number requested. If the keyword "LAST" is used, this tells the server to send all updates up to the most recent one available at the time of the request.\n\nThis is an example of accessing the NRTM data stream using telnet and pulling the serials from 11012700 to the latest available.\n\n$ telnet whois.ripe.net 4444\nTrying 193.0.0.135...\nConnected to whois.ripe.net.\nEscape character is \'^]\'.\n\n-g RIPE:3:11012700-LAST\n\n% Rights restricted by copyright.\n% See http://www.ripe.net/db/copyright.html\n\n%START Version: 3 RIPE 11012700-11012701\n\nDEL 11012701\n\ninetnum: 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\nnetname: RIPE-NCC\ndescr: RIPE Network Coordination Centre\ncountry: NL\nadmin-c: RIPE124-RIPE\ntech-c: RIPE124-RIPE\nstatus: ALLOCATED PA\nnotify: bit-bucket@ripe.net\nmnt-by: NAGIOS-MNT\ncreated: 2003-03-17T12:15:57Z\nlast-modified: 2017-12-04T14:42:31Z\nsource: RIPE\n\n\nA client may request a persistent connection by including the -k query flag with a mirroring request (-g query flag). In this case, the last argument is ignored and the server supplies the new object as soon as they are processed. The client is responsible for closing the connection. A persistent connection for mirroring does not time out, but the connection may break if there is a server error.\n\nA client can use the -q sources flag with the mirror server to retrieve information regarding available mirroring possibilities. Please see this section for more details.\n\nAt the beginning of the data stream, the server will send the following string:\n\n%START Version: NRTM_Protocol_version_# source first-last\n\n\nFor example:\n\n%START Version: 3 RIPE:1539595-1539597\n\n\nAfter the last piece of data is sent to the client, the server will send to string:\n\n%END *source*\n\n\nto signal the end of transmission. For example:\n\n%END RIPE\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Near Real Time Mirroring v3\n\nThe RIPE NCC NRTM is a publicly available service that allows users to receive a stream of available data from the RIPE Database on a server.

It includes integrity checks through signing and enhances scalability by generating files once and distributing them over HTTPS. For more information, refer to draft-ietf-grow-nrtm-v4.html.\n\nThis protocol has draft RFC status and is subject to change.\n\n\n# Snapshot Initialization\n\nWe initialise the Snapshot during the first export for the Database or if there is a history lost and cannot produce continuous deltas. The server notifies to the user when this happens, to ensure that the client have a complete view or need to reinitialise.\n\n 1. A session ID (random v4 UUID) is generated. This token is unique for RIPE Database.\n 2. A new Snapshot is generated for version one, this Snapshot may be empty if the database is empty.\n 3. A new Update Notification File is generated with the same session ID created in the first step. The session ID is referencing the Update Notification File with the Snapshot. This first snapshot doesn\'t have any Delta.\n 4. We update the Update Notification File with the new contents.\n\nEach Database (i.e: RIPE and RIPE-NONAUTH) has separate session IDs, snapshots, deltas and Update Notification Files, even if published by the same server instance.\n\n\n# Publishing updates\n\n\n# Update Notification File\n\nThe Update Notification File is essential for mirror clients to determine changes between their local Database state and the RIPE Database. It provides:\n\n * Information on the Snapshot File and Delta Files.\n * Timestamp for freshness checking.\n\nThe Update Notification File ensure efficient and accurate synchronisation between the RIPE database and the client\'s database by providing clear metadata, previse change details, and robust validation mechanisms. Clients must rely on this file to maintain up-to-date copies of the RIPE Database.\n\n 1. nrtm_version: must be 4\n 2. timestamp: is adhered to RFC3339 format, providing an accurate timestamp of when the Update Notification File was generated.\n 3. type: must be "notification".\n 4. next_signing_key: (optional) if present, denotes that public key for future key rotation.\n 5. source: identifies the source (i.e: RIPE, RIPE-NONAUTH), ensuring consistency with the RIPE Database data.\n 6. session_id: It is a unique v4 UUID assigned to this session and source, crucial for synchronisation and tracking.\n 7. version: represents the latest version number, aligning with the highest version of the included snapshot and deltas.\n 8. snapshot: contains the details of the Snapshot File, including the version, URL foe retrieval, and SHA-256 hash for integrity verification.\n 9. deltas: List all Delta Files with their respective version numbers, URLs, and hashes ensuring sequential continuity and data integrity checks.\n\nMore information here.\n\n * Example:\n\n{\n  "nrtm_version": 4,\n  "timestamp": "2022-01-01T15:00:00Z",\n  "type": "notification",\n  "next_signing_key": "bnJ0..bXY0",\n  "source": "RIPE",\n  "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",\n  "version": 4,\n  "snapshot": {\n    "version": 3,\n    "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-snapshot.2.047595d0fae972fbed0c51b4a41c7a349e0c47bb.json.gz",\n    "hash": "9a..86"\n  },\n  "deltas": [\n    {\n      "version": 2,\n      "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-delta.1.784a2a65aba22e001fd25a1b9e8544e058fbc703.json",\n      "hash": "62..a2"\n    },\n    {\n      "version": 3,\n      "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-delta.2.0f681f07cfab5611f3681bf030ec9f6fa3442fb0.json",\n      "hash": "25..9a"\n    },\n    {\n      "version": 4,\n      "url": "https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-delta.3.d9c194acbb2cb0d4088c9d8a25d5871cdd802c79.json",\n      "hash": "b4..13"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n * URL:\n\nENVIRONMENT   PUBLIC KEY URL\nPROD          https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json\nRC            https://nrtm-rc.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json\n\n\n# Snapshot File\n\nThe Snapshot File contains the complete and current contents of the RIPE Database, and clients should use it to initialise or reinitialise their local Database copies.\n\nTo avoid issues where a client retrieves an Update Notification File just before it is updated, servers should retain old Snapshot Files for at least 5 minutes after a new Update Notification File is published. This allows clients to complete the retrieval of the snapshot without encountering inconsistencies.\n\nThe Snapshot File is formatted as JSON Text Sequences. It contains one or more records. The first record is the header, followed by the RPSL records.\n\n 1. A new Snapshot File will be generated every day between 1 am and 2 am.\n 2. nrtm_version: must be set to 4.\n 3. version: must be an unsigned positive integer and match the version field in the Update Notification File.\n 4. type: must be "snapshot".\n 5. source: must match the source field in the Update Notification File.\n 6. session_id: must match the session_id in the Update Notification File.\n 7. It is cached for 1 week. It is an immutable file.\n\nMore information here.\n\n * Example:\n\n{\n  "nrtm_version": 4,\n  "type": "snapshot",\n  "source": "RIPE",\n  "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",\n  "version": 3\n}\n{"object": "route: 192.0.2.0/24\\norigin: AS65530\\nsource: RIPE"}\n{"object": "route: 2001:db8::/32\\norigin: AS65530\\nsource: RIPE"}\n\n\n\n# Delta File\n\nDelta files are used for keeping track of the changes done to the Database. The delta file is always compared with the previous delta file, so there will never be a version 1. The first delta will be compared with the initialized snapshot and will have the version number 2.\n\nDelta Files are used to record changes to RPSL objects between snapshots. They ensure that clients can keep their databases synchronized with the source by applying only the changes that occurred since the last synchronization.\n\n 1.  If there have been changes, a Delta File is published each minute.\n 2.  All the changes are included, even if some cancel each other out, like an addition and deletion of the same object.\n 3.  Each Delta File have a version number one greater than the last Delta File or Snapshot File Version.\n 4.  All the changes are in order they occurred during the time frame.\n 5.  Deltas older than 24 hours will be removed, after generating a new one.\n 6.  Update Notification File will include the new Delta File and the updated database version.\n 7.  Must match the session_id of the Update Notification File.\n 8.  Must match the source of the Update Notification File.\n 9.  nrtm_version: must be set to 4.\n 10. type: must be delta.\n 11. It is cached for one week. It is an immutable file.\n\nMore information here\n\n * Example:\n\n{\n  "nrtm_version": 4,\n  "type": "delta",\n  "source": "RIPE",\n  "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",\n  "version": 3\n}\n{\n  "action": "delete",\n  "object_class": "person",\n  "primary_key": "PRSN1-RIPE"\n}\n{\n  "action": "delete",\n  "object_class": "route",\n  "primary_key": "192.0.2.0/24AS65530"\n}\n{\n  "action": "add_modify",\n  "object": "route: 2001:db8::/32\\norigin: AS65530\\nsource: RIPE"\n}\n\n\n\n# Key Configuration\n\nTo enable NRTMv4 we generate and configure a private Ed25519 key and provide the corresponding public key, the IRR Database name, and the publication URL of the Update Notification File. The public key is base64 encoded. The key is available in the next_signing_key attribute in the notification file.\n\nWe provide the public key file on a separate server.\n\nENVIRONMENT   PUBLIC KEY URL\nPROD          https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/nrtmv4/nrtmv4_public_key.txt\nRC            https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/nrtmv4/nrtmv4_public_key_rc.txt\n\n\n# Key Rotation\n\nThe public key will rotate approximately once a year for security reasons. The process for in-band key rotation involves:\n\n 1. Generating and configuring a new key as the upcoming signing key.\n 2. Including this key in the next_signing_key field of the Update Notification File, which propagates to mirror clients within 24 hours.\n 3. Optionally refreshing the Notification Update File earlier.\n 4. Mirror clients store the new key from the next_signing_key field upon retrieving the Update Notification File.\n 5. After a week, the server operator makes the new key active and removes the old key. Future Notification Files will be signed with the new key and will not include a next_signing_key field.\n 6. If a client\'s signature validation fails, it must attempt to verify using the previously encountered next_signing_key and update its configuration if successful.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Setup RIPE Database Mirror\n\nThere are three ways to set up a mirror of the RIPE database.\n\n 1. Using GRS import.\n    \n    The GRS Import method is updated once per day.\n    \n    * First follow the whois installation instructions, to have a working whois installation.\n    \n    * Create a LOCAL database, and a WHOIS_MIRROR_RIPE_GRS database, and create tables in both using the whois_schema.sql script.\n    \n    * The LOCAL database will be used for any local changes.\n    \n    * The WHOIS_MIRROR_RIPE_GRS database will be used for the mirror data.\n    \n    * Configure the properties file as follows (you will need to customise the example whois.properties):\n    \n      whois.source=LOCAL\n      ...\n      grs.sources=RIPE-GRS\n      grs.sources.dummify=\n      ...\n      grs.import.sources=RIPE-GRS\n      grs.import.enabled=true\n      ...\n      grs.import.ripe.resourceDataUrl=ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/stats/delegated-ripencc-extended-latest\n      grs.import.ripe.download=ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.db.gz\n      grs.import.ripe.source=RIPE-GRS\n      ...\n      whois.db.master.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/LOCAL;driver=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver\n      ...\n      whois.db.slave.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/LOCAL\n      ...\n      whois.db.grs.master.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/WHOIS_MIRROR\n      whois.db.grs.slave.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/WHOIS_MIRROR\n      ...\n    \n    \n    Start whois, using the next command. Use -Ddump.total.size.limit to specify the dump size:\n    \n    /usr/bin/java -Dwhois -Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dhazelcast.jmx=true -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -Xms1024m -Xmx8g -Dwhois.config=properties -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dhazelcast.config=hazelcast.xml -Dlog4j.configurationFile=file:log4j2.xml -jar whois.jar\n    \n    \n    * The GRS import will run automatically every midnight. Or, connect to the process using JMX, and start the GRS import.\n    \n      $ java --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=ALL-UNNAMED -jar jmxterm-<version>-uber.jar -v verbose\n      >    open <pid>\n      >    bean net.ripe.db.whois:name=GrsImport\n      >    run grsImport "RIPE-GRS" "test"\n      #calling operation grsImport of mbean net.ripe.db.whois:name=GrsImport\n      #operation returns:\n      GRS import started\n    \n    \n    * Monitor progress by checking the log4j console output, the import will take around 2 hours to complete.\n    \n    * You can query for objects in the mirror using for example:\n      \n        -s RIPE-GRS 82.185.158.240 - 82.185.158.247\n        --resource 82.185.158.240 - 82.185.158.247\n      \n\n 2. Using Bootstrap and NRTMv3.\n    \n    With this method the mirror database gets updated in near real time.\n    \n    This page describes the process of loading the empty mirror database with a nightly export of the RIPE database.\n    \n    * First follow the whois installation instructions here, to have a working whois installation.\n    \n    * Create a LOCAL database, and a WHOIS_MIRROR_RIPE_GRS database, and create tables in both using the whois_schema.sql script.\n    \n    * Download a snapshot of the RIPE DB here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.db.gz\n    \n    * Save the serial number that corresponds to the above snapshot from here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/RIPE.CURRENTSERIAL\n    \n    * Both snapshot and RIPE.CURRENTSERIAL are updated every night.\n    \n    * If you want to use automatic updates using NRTM, the dump should be at most 2 weeks old.\n    \n    * Configure the properties file as follows (you will need to customise the example whois.properties):\n      \n        whois.source=LOCAL\n        …\n        grs.sources=RIPE-GRS\n        grs.sources.dummify=\n        …\n        # GRS source-specific properties to acquire dumps\n        grs.import.enabled=false\n        grs.import.sources=\n      \n        # NRTM client\n        nrtm.import.enabled=false\n        nrtm.import.sources=\n        ...\n        whois.db.master.url=jdbc:log:mariadb://localhost/LOCAL;driver=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver\n        ...\n        whois.db.slave.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/LOCAL\n        …\n        whois.db.grs.master.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/WHOIS_MIRROR\n        whois.db.grs.slave.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/WHOIS_MIRROR\n      \n    \n    * Start the whois server using the following command. Use -Ddump.total.size.limit to specify the dump size:\n      \n        /usr/bin/java -Dwhois -Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dhazelcast.jmx=true -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -Xms1024m -Xmx8g -Dwhois.config=properties -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dhazelcast.config=hazelcast.xml -Dlog4j.configurationFile=file:log4j2.xml -jar whois.jar\n      \n    \n    * Initiate the loading of the dump file using the Bootstrap command from JMX. The import could take several hours.\n      \n        % java --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=ALL-UNNAMED -jar jmxterm-<version>-uber.jar -v verbose\n        > bean net.ripe.db.whois:name=Bootstrap\n        > run loadDump initialimport <path to ripe.db.gz>\n      \n    \n    * When the import is finished exit the jmx console, and test that it worked by executing a query using telnet:\n      \n        % telnet localhost 1043\n        > 193.0.0.1 - 193.0.7.255\n      \n    \n    The above jmx call will load the LOCAL database with the snapshot of the objects from the FTP dump.\n    \n    * Now you need to stop the server and copy the LOCAL database to WHOIS_MIRROR_RIPE_GRS.\n      \n        % kill <PID>\n        % mysqldump -udbint -p  LOCAL > LOCAL.sql\n        % mysql -udbint -p WHOIS_MIRROR_RIPE_GRS < LOCAL.sql\n      \n    \n    * The above steps are important because you cannot mirror a remote database directly to the main source (LOCAL), and also you cannot load directly with the JMX call an FTP dump to the mirrored database.\n    \n    * The mirrored content has to be persisted to WHOIS_MIRROR_grs.source, in our case WHOIS_MIRROR_RIPE_GRS.\n    \n    * Note that the properties:\n      \n        whois.db.grs.master.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/WHOIS_MIRROR\n        whois.db.grs.slave.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/WHOIS_MIRROR\n      \n    \n    have to be like that, because they are dynamically suffixed by the grs.sources (RIPE-GRS)\n    \n    * Start the server and check that the mirrored source is working:\n    \n       % /usr/bin/java -Dwhois -Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dhazelcast.jmx=true -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -Xms1024m -Xmx8g -Dwhois.config=properties -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dhazelcast.config=hazelcast.xml -Dlog4j.configurationFile=file:log4j2.xml -jar whois.jar\n       <wait>\n       % telnet localhost 1043\n       > -s RIPE-GRS 193.0.0.1 - 193.0.7.255\n    \n    \n    * If the query is successful, we can proceed with Setup automatic updating with NRTMv3.\n\nA server with 16GB RAM, 8 GB swap, and 160GB disk space is recommended for mirroring. Please note that running your own mirror is not supported!\n\n 3. Using IRRd with NRTMv4.\n    \n    This feature is in development and is subject to change.\n    \n    With this method the mirror database gets updated in near real time.\n    \n    This section outline the essential steps for configuring, initializing, and maintaining synchronisation using Snapshot Files and Delta Files. By following these protocols, mirror clients ensure accurate and timely updates of RIPE Database information, while maintaining security and integrity through cryptographic verification processes.\n    \n    * Install IRRd.\n    * Configure IRRd for NRTMv4: Modify your IRRd configuration to enable support for NRTMv4. This typically involves configuring the URLs for Snapshot Files, Delta Files, and the Update Notification File. Ensure that IRRd is set up to server these files over HTTPS.\n    \n    # NRTMv4 specific settings for the RIPE database\n    nrtm:\n       version: 4  # NRTMv4 version\n       url:\n          snapshot: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-snapshot  # URL for Snapshot Files\n          deltas: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-deltas      # URL for Delta Files\n          update_notification: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json  # URL for Update Notification File\n       keys:\n          public: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/update-notification-file.json.sig  # Path to the public key for signature verification\n    \n    \n    * Initialise IRRd: Initialise IRRd with the necessary IRR database that supports NRTMv4. This involves loading the initial dataset and setting up the necessary configurations.\n    \n    # IRR database configuration\n    databases:\n       - name: RIPE # RIPE database settings\n    import_sources:\n       - https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/RIPE/nrtm-snapshot.1.RIPE.x.y.json.gz  #Import initial data from an HTTPS source\n    \n    \n    * Querying Data: Use the IRRd command-line tools or APIs to query data from the NRTMv4 database. For example:\n      * Use irrd-clientand irrd-shell to query objects and updates.\n      * Fetch and view the Snapshot Files and Delta Files to understand the current state and changes in the database.\n    * Update Notifications: Monitor the Update Notification File and Delta Files to stay updated with changes in the database. Configure IRRd to regularly publish these files according to the NRTMv4 specifications.\n    * Handling Updates: Process Delta Files to apply incremental updates to your local instance of IRRd, ensuring synchronisation with the latest changes in the database.\n    \n    For more detailed explanations about how to use IRRd client please refer to their documentation\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Attribute Names\n\nAttribute names have a precisely defined syntax and only use alphanumeric and characters and hyphens (-). They are not case-sensitive, but the software converts them all to lower case. The attribute name must start at column 0 and must immediately be followed by a colon (:). No spaces or tabs are allowed anywhere within the name, before the name, or in-between the attribute name and the colon. For example, the below notation is correct: mntner: TEST-DBM-MNT This is correct because there is no space between the colon (:) and the attribute name (mntner).\n\nThe software is very strict on these points, but they are common user mistakes. There are many aspects to the formatting of attributes and values and the relationship between them. It is not easy to change just one element of this formatting.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Attribute Properties\n\nAttributes can be used in different ways in different objects. Currently, there are three properties that apply to all attributes:\n\n * Presence\n * Repeat\n * Indexed\n\nThe allowed attributes for any object type are shown in the object templates (see the section \'RPSL Object Types\').\n\n\n# Presence\n\nNot all allowed attributes need to be present in every instance of the object type. The table below shows how presence is defined for an attribute. The same attribute name may have a different presence defined in different object types. For example "status:" is mandatory in an inetnum object, but generated in an aut-num object.\n\nTypes of ‘presence\' of an Attribute\n\nTYPE          DESCRIPTION\n[mandatory]   You must include at least one instance of this attribute in\n              all objects of this type.\n[optional]    This attribute is optional in the objects of this type and\n              you can leave it out. If you choose to include this\n              attribute then the value must also be included.\n[required]    The syntax rules define this attribute as optional. However,\n              additional business rules require this attribute under some\n              circumstances.\n[generated]   These attributes are generated if you leave them out. If you\n              include the attribute and provide the value, it may be\n              replaced by a value determined by the software.\n\n\n# Repeat\n\nAttributes can have single or multiple values. Note that it is the value that matters more than the attribute here. An attribute can only take a comma-separated list of values if it is defined as multiple.\n\nFor an attribute defined as single in an object template, there can only be one instance of this attribute in an object of that type and it can only have a single value (even if this attribute is defined as being able to have a list of values).\n\nFor an attribute defined as multiple in an object template, there can be many instances of this attribute in an object of that type. If any of these attributes can have a list of values then it is allowed for multiple attributes.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of times a multiple attribute can be added to an object. But there is an overall limit on the size of an object.\n\nTYPE         DESCRIPTION\n[single]     Objects can only contain one instance of this\n             ‘attribute–value\' pair.\n[multiple]   Objects may contain more than one instance of this\n             attribute. For some attributes, an instance may contain a\n             list of values, separated by commas.\n\n\n# Indexed\n\nMany attribute values are indexed within the database. This is necessary to provide fast, efficient lookups of data. All objects\' primary keys are indexed. These and any other indexed value may be used to do standard lookups or reverse lookups.\n\nA standard lookup is where you look for an object that contains the specified value. Where this value can be found in an object depends on the index tables built with that attribute value.\n\nAn inverse lookup is where you look for objects that contain the specified value in the list of specified attribute types. (See more about indexed searches in the section on Querying the RIPE Database.)\n\nwhois –i mnt-by,mnt-lower,mnt-routes: AARDVARK-MNT\n\n\nIndexes are built internally within the database. This property does not affect nor put any restrictions on the data entered by a user.\n\nTable 3.5 Types of ‘indexes\' of an Attribute\n\nTYPE            DESCRIPTION\n[lookup key]    This attribute is indexed.\n[inverse key]   This attribute is in the "reverse" index.\n[primary key]   This attribute is (part of) the primary key for this object\n                type.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Attribute Values\n\nThe value part of the attribute-value pair starts after the colon (:). It can immediately follow the colon, or spaces or tabs may be used to separate them. The format and content of a value is determined by the syntax definition for that attribute within that object type. The same attribute name may be used in more than one object type. Often, the syntax definition will be the same for an attribute regardless of which object type it is used in. For example, the "admin-c:" attribute appears in most object types with the same definition of its syntax. But sometimes the attribute may be defined in a different way in different object types. For example "status:" is used in inetnum, inet6num and aut-num objects. For each of these object types, "status:" has a different meaning with a different pre-defined set of values.\n\nThe value can contain some pre-defined keywords at any place within the value as determined by the syntax definition for that attribute within that object type. It can also contain references to other objects and free text. You can refer to other objects by using their primary key values. These references and the keywords have a precisely defined syntax. If the objects you refer to do not already exist in the database, you will see error messages and your update will fail. The free text has no syntax, but may only contain Latin-1 recognisable characters.\n\nSome attribute values may contain spaces and tab characters to help make the information easier to read, as long as the syntax definition allows it. Note that spaces work better than tabs, as tabs can display differently on different machines.\n\nIf an attribute is included in an object, it must have a value unless the value is defined as free text. Even generated attributes, if included in the object, must have a syntactically valid value. The software may change this value, however, if the value is missing there will be a syntax error.\n\n\n# Split Values\n\nIn most cases, a value can be split over multiple lines. Each continuation line must start with a space, tab or plus (+) in column zero. Continuation lines do not include the attribute name.\n\nAn object cannot have a blank line inside it because this would mark the end of the object. A blank continuation line must start with the ‘+\' sign in column zero.\n\nAn example of a correct continuation line:\n\naddress:  Singel 258\n+\n      Amsterdam \n\n\nNote the ‘+\' in column zero on the second, blank line.\n\nValues cannot be split in the first attribute, which defines the object type, or in the primary key attribute(s). If this is done, the software will re-combine these attributes into a single-line value. The update will not fail.\n\nWhen parsing an object, the software will internally recombine continuation line values into a single value for processing. The values from multiple lines are joined with a single space in-between them. Therefore, it is also not possible to split a value in the middle of a word or within any text string. The object is stored in the database with any valid split values.\n\n\n# End-of-line Comments\n\nIn most cases, an end of line comment can be added at the end of a value. These start with a hash (#) and continue until the end of the physical line (a newline character ‘\\n\'). If a value is split over several lines, any or all of the lines may include an end of line comment. You cannot continue the comment on another line- these comments always stop at the end of the line in which they start. An end of line comment cannot start at column 0. It is possible to add end of line comments on several consecutive lines, which together form a block of text. However, for long comments, it is better to use the "remarks:" attribute.\n\nadmin-c: dw-ripe  # these NIC Handles\ntech-c:  dw-ripe  # form a set of contacts\nzone-c:  dw-ripe  # for this object\n\n\nAny free form value cannot contain a hash (#) character, as this would be recognised as the start of a comment. Although the software does not process comments, in some situations it does strip off the comments before using the values.\n\nIf split values and end of line comments are used together, the software strips off the end of line comments before the split values are combined.\n\nEnd of line comments cannot be added to the first attribute value, which defines the object type, or to the primary key attribute(s) value. If this is done the software will strip them off. The update will not fail. These comments are also not allowed on the "source:" attribute value. If one is added here, the update will fail.\n\nLong, end of line comments or long, free form attribute values can cause problems. Some email clients automatically break lines at certain points. If your email client does this on an update message then your update will fail. It may not be obvious at first sight that this has happened. Fortunately, there are many other options for submitting updates if this problem occurs.\n\n\n# List Values\n\nSome attributes allow the value to be a list. This must be a comma-separated list with no spaces allowed. These attributes can be viewed in the Appendix.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Attributes in an Object\n\nThe first attribute must have the same name as the object type. This identifies the object type. The currently available object types are shown in the sub-sections, \'List of Primary Objects\' and \'List of Secondary Objects\'. If the type is not recognised, that part of an update message will be seen as a paragraph of text and will be disregarded with an appropriate error message. If the unrecognised type is in a query, it will be rejected with an error.\n\nOther attributes can appear in any order, but most people stick to the order as shown in the object templates (see the section \'RPSL Object Types\'). Each object type is defined to have a set of possible attributes. The set for each object type is defined within the software and shown in the template.\n\nEach instance of an object type is uniquely defined by a primary key. For most object types, the primary key is normally the value of the first attribute. In some cases, it is a different attribute value or a composite of more than one attribute value. The primary key only has to be unique within an object type. Objects of different types can sometimes have the same primary key, as long as the key fits the syntax for both object types. For example ‘FRED\' is a valid name for a mntner object. ‘FRED\' is also a valid "nic-hdl:" value, which is the primary key for a person or role object.\n\nEach attribute name must start on a separate line. However, not every line needs an attribute as values can continue over several lines. A blank line marks the end of an object . Technically this is two consecutive newline characters, \\n\\n. For this reason, you cannot include a completely blank line in the middle of an object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Database Objects\n\nThe RIPE Database contains records of:\n\n * Allocations and assignments of IP address space (the IP address registry or INR);\n * Reverse domain registrations;\n * Routing policy information (the Internet Routing Registry or IRR);\n * Contact information (details of people who are registered as contacts for the Internet resources used in the operation of networks or routers, and their organisations).\n\nThe records in the RIPE Database are known as ‘objects\'. Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) defines the basic syntax of database objects. For further information see RFC 2622. But, over the years, practical operations have resulted in a number of deviations from the basic RPSL definition. Many extensions have also been made to the RIPE implementation of RPSL for the RIPE Database. Some features of RPSL were never implemented and others have been removed as requirements changed. For engineering-minded people, these database objects (records) should not be confused with the objects used in object-orientated programming languages that are used to write the software.\n\nThere are many types of objects in the database. These are described in the section: \'RPSL Object Types\'. Objects contain a piece of information relating to an Internet resource or a supporting or administrative function. Objects can reference other objects and these references must be followed to obtain the full description of an Internet resource. Inheritance is not used, which means that some references must be duplicated across large numbers of objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# How to Organize Your Data\n\nThere are many different types of objects in the RIPE Database. Some of them can be used in different ways. How you use them makes a big difference to the workload needed to maintain the data.\n\nThe RIPE Database is intended for those who have, or will soon have Internet resources. This database is a public registry with a well-defined purpose. See \'Purpose of the RIPE Database\' for more details. You can create many objects in the RIPE Database without any resources. But if these objects are not referenced by any resource object within a specified time period they will all be deleted. See the section on Garbage Collection for more details.\n\nResource holders using the RIPE Database need a basic set of objects:\n\n * organisation\n * role\n * person\n * mntner\n\nFor new members, this set of objects will be set up by the RIPE NCC as part of the new LIR process. How you use these objects will affect how much maintenance you need to perform later.\n\n\n# Using the Organisation Object\n\nThe organisation object was introduced in 2004, long after the RIPE Database data model was designed. The organisation object can make life easier in some situations.\n\nConsider all users as organisations, whether they are multinational companies, universities or individuals. To use the RIPE Database, each of these organisations needs a set of data objects that represent their business model. The organisation must have:\n\n 1. People who can be contacted\n 2. These people have defined roles in the business\n 3. These roles include responsibility for Internet resources\n 4. These resources need authorisation tokens to protect them\n 5. These tokens may need public keys.\n\nThis set of objects represents your organisation. When the organisation is an individual who has been assigned some PI space, they may need several objects in the database. Multinational companies may have many hundreds of thousands of objects.\n\nThe organisation object was introduced as a way of keeping track of these sets of objects. The idea is to put the organisational identity of the entity at the centre by defining its organisation object. The organisation\'s business model can then be mapped out by creating the objects from the list above as appropriate. Each of these objects can be directly linked to the organisation object using the "org:" attribute. Or for a simplified model, link the mntner objects using the "org:" attribute in each mntner object. All objects must be maintained, so there is an indirect reference back to the organisation object through the mntner objects.\n\nSome multinational companies may have a distributed business model with different parts of the organisation responsible for different parts of their network. In this situation additional organisation objects can be created. These objects can reference the main organisation object through their own "org:" attribute. This allows users to keep track of the entire company\'s data or the parts delegated to different sections of the company.\n\nBy using these "org:" references, bulk changes to data are very much simplified. Tools can be written and deployed more easily. New ideas can be rolled out quickly across an entire data set. The more structured you make your data, the more easily it is to automate processes.\n\nWhen the organisation object was first introduced there was some resistance to make references to it for fear of the public or competitors being able to map out their business. But now that there are so many ways to (inverse) query the data, it is not difficult to find all resources or customers of any organisation. If you don\'t set up your data in a structured way, the management of the data becomes more complicated.\n\nBasically the organisation object should be the centre of your presence in the RIPE Database. All your human resources and Internet resources and authentication tokens should hang off this central point.\n\n\n# Using the Role Object\n\nThe person and role objects are often said to be interchangeable:\n\n * They share the same name space in the RIPE Database, but names can be duplicated.\n * The NIC Handles are only unique across the two object types combined, so both object types can\'t exist with the same NIC Handle.\n * Either a role or person object can be used everywhere that requires a reference to a contact, with only a couple of exceptions where it must be one type or the other.\n\nHowever, these two objects have very different functions. A person object holds personal details about an individual. A role object should describe a business function or operational unit and may reference the individual people responsible for this activity. References to person objects are optional in the role object.\n\nUsing role objects makes large-scale changes easier. The principle is the same if you have ten objects or 10,000 objects in the database. However, problems most commonly occur when dealing with a very large number of objects.\n\nMany organisations create a large number of objects that directly reference a person object, and experience difficulties if this person leaves the company. The organisation may be responsible for many objects of different types, possibly with several different mntner objects protecting them, and finding them and getting all the authorisations right to change the references can easily become a problem.\n\nWorking within certain guidelines can help avoid this situation:\n\nOnly use a person object as a holder of personal information Only reference a person object in role objects Reference the role objects in all the other places where contact data is required If the person responsible for a business role or function changes, then it is only necessary to modify a few role objects to reference a different person object. All references to the role objects remain valid. The scale of the changes you need to make is very much reduced.\n\nEven if you have only a handful of objects in the database, it is good practice to do this. Your business may grow, and time restraints mean that you may not go back and change things until you absolutely have to do so. This is how these objects were designed for use, but as this practice was never enforced by software business rules, much of the database still makes direct references to person objects.\n\n\n# Abuse Details\n\nThe irt object (Internet Response Team) was introduced to identify a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) for handling serious network problems like DOS attacks. It was later modified to make it usable for more general abuse. But all the old ways of documenting abuse were also still available. Now with the introduction of "abuse-c:" this general abuse is moving away from the irt object again. After a data cleanup, the irt object will only be used for CSIRT teams again and should not be used to handle general abuse complaints.\n\nGeneral abuse is now handled by the organisation object. This should reference an abuse handling role object with an "abuse-c:" attribute. This role object must include an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. All RIPE NCC allocated address space and direct end user assignments, represented by inet(6)num and aut-num objects, should reference an organisation object directly. All more specific address space objects inherit this reference. The abuse handler for this address space and all the more specific address space to that specified by the inet(6)num object is determined by the referenced organisation object.\n\nThere is a query flag (-c) which will return the irt object, if one exists, for any specified inet(6)num object. There is also another query flag (-b) that will find the indirectly referenced role object, extract the "abuse-mailbox:" attribute and return brief details including the email address from the role object.\n\n\n# Who Maintains the Data?\n\nThis is one of those areas that some users don\'t pay much attention to, but it is one of the most important questions regarding the use of the RIPE Database. Anyone authorised to maintain your data can cause serious damage to your network, your business and the business of your customers if they make a mistake. Authorisation is an all or nothing concept. You cannot authorise someone to create and modify customer\'s details but not delete it, for example.\n\nFor details of the technical workings of authorisation see the section, \'Authorisation\'. This section is about how to set up who can authorise what.\n\nThe authorisation model is based on the mntner object. This is a box that holds credentials. There are different types of credentials with passwords, PGP certificates and single sign-on (SSO) usernames being the main ones. At the time of writing, these credentials don\'t need to match anyone who is registered in the RIPE Database with a person object. They are simply lists of credentials that can belong to anyone. It is therefore not possible for the database software to identify ‘who\' authorised an update. The introduction of SSO as a credential is a step in this direction.\n\nEvery object in the RIPE Database must now be protected by a mntner object referenced by a "mnt-by:" attribute. The mntner object is also protected by a "mnt-by:" attribute. Normally, this references itself.\n\nFor a small organisation with only a few objects in the database you may decide that you only need one mntner object. This is created with one or more credentials and maintains itself. Every object you create in the RIPE Database is maintained by this mntner object. The people whose credentials are in the mntner object all have equal and full control over all of your database objects. They can create, modify and delete anything. Because of the anonymous way credentials are used in the mntner object, the software cannot identify which credential made the update, only that a specific mntner object was used.\n\nFor larger organisations with potentially hundreds of thousands of objects in the database you may want to distribute authority to maintain data. How you distribute it depends on your business model. One example could be for a multi-national organisation with customers in different countries to partition your address space allocations by country. You could have a separate team managing the network in each country, each with their own mntner object. The "mnt-lower:" attribute on the partitioned allocations restricts control to those teams.\n\nAnother possibility is to have separate teams handling address space, reverse delegations and routing. This can be set up using the appropriate "mnt-xxx:" attributes. For example "mnt-routes:".\n\nYou may also want to control who can grant authority to manage your data. Normally a mntner object maintains itself. This means anyone who has a credential in that mntner object can also change the mntner object. So they can add another password so that another person can make changes. In a large organisation, you may want a security team to control the mntner objects. In this case you can create a mntner object for the security team. All other mntner objects are maintained by this security team mntner. Only the security team can then allow someone else authority to maintain some data by adding their credential to the appropriate mntner object.\n\n\n# How do I keep an audit trail of changes to my data?\n\nYou can use notifications to keep track of changes to your data. This section details how to set up who gets notified of what.\n\nThe \'Notifications\' section details the technical workings of notifications and how to set up who gets notified of what.\n\nThere are many ways to set up notifications. If you want to know everything, you should use the mntner objects. All of your data is maintained by one or more mntner objects. These objects have a mandatory attribute "upd-to:". This lets you know if someone is trying to hack into your data. Any update to objects maintained by this mntner object that fails on authorisation gets notified to this email address. There is also an optional attribute "mnt-nfy" in the mntner object. This notifies you of every successful update to any object maintained by this mntner object.\n\nMost people direct notifications to individuals in the organisation, which is adequate if those individuals want to know about changes to objects they have some responsibility for, or interest in. However, these emails are often missed, ignored or simply deleted. If there is an issue that results from a change made some time ago, the information you received about the change may have been lost.\n\nOne way to keep an audit trail of changes is to set up a specific email address that you can reference in all of your mntner objects, in both email attribute types. You can set up a script that monitors that email address and archives all emails to a log file or database. You then have an audit trail of changes made to your objects. One thing that is missing is the acknowledgement message. For email updates, this is only returned to the address that submits the update. For web form updates or RESTful API updates, there is no acknowledgement message sent anywhere. The response is returned to the web session. However, for all updates, the software still generates the human-readable acknowledgement message that is returned in response to an email update. This is logged internally in the RIPE NCC\'s update logs, but only sent to the user if the update was submitted by email. Without a copy of this acknowledgement message, it is not possible to have a complete audit trail of who did what and when they did it.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# List of Primary Objects\n\nThese are the currently supported objects in the RIPE Database that are considered to be primary data.\n\nOBJECT TYPE   SHORT NAME   DESCRIPTION\naut-num       an           Holds information about an Autonomous System (AS) Number.

For example inetnum and aut-num objects hold Internet resource information. Also, route and domain objects hold details of routing agreements and reverse delegations.\n\nSecondary objects provide supporting and administrative details for primary objects. For example, person objects hold contact information for someone related to an Internet resource. Or organisation objects hold details of resource holders.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# REST API Data model\n\n\n# WhoisResources\n\n\n# Description\n\nThe RIPE Database REST API uses a uniform format for transferring structured data.

}\n}\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# The Attributes in Database Objects\n\nAll objects in the RIPE Database have the same structure. They contain a set of ‘attribute-value\' pairs in plain text. These ‘attribute-value\' pairs can take different forms. Attributes are sometimes referred to as ‘keys\'.\n\nAll the database content is currently in Latin-1 encoding. Any characters not in Latin-1 is automatically converted to Latin-1. Any characters without an equivalent in Latin-1 are substituted with a question mark character. One exception is that IDN domain names in email address attributes are automatically converted to Punycode.\n\nWhen an object is stored in the database, the full text supplied by the user is stored as a single item as close as possible to what the user supplied. This means that the attributes and values are almost unchanged and the order is maintained. The spacing between the attributes and values may be adjusted to align the values and make them easier to read. Parts of the object are also extracted from the text and stored in separate tables and indexes along with some generated metadata to help with database functionality.\n\nThis is a list of changes that are made to the data supplied by the user:\n\n * Generate or change supplied values for generated attributes\n * Add missing "status:" to an aut-num object with generated value\n * Set/reset "status:" to \'LEGACY\' on more specific objects to a legacy object\n * Change all attribute names to lower case\n * Change source value to upper case\n * Remove a trailing dot on reverse domain keys\n * Remove tabs and excess spaces from inetnum ranges and inet(6)num status values\n * Remove leading zeroes from inetnum ranges\n * Convert inetnum prefix value to a range\n * Convert inet6num values to canonical format\n * Remove end of line comments from primary and type attributes\n * Join up split values in primary and type attributes\n\nIn some cases an information message is added to the acknowledgement sent back to the user making the update. For example:\n\n***Info:    Value 193.in-addr.arpa. converted to 193.in-addr.arpa\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# RPSL Object Types\n\nIn this section, the many types of objects in the RIPE Database are described. Objects contain a piece of information relating to an Internet resource or a supporting or administrative function.\n\nFor each object, a template shows which attributes are allowed for this type. The properties of the attributes are also shown, as they apply to the attributes within this object type. Following the template, some description is included about the definition and use of the included attributes.\n\nIn the object templates, required attributes are shown as ‘optional*\'. This is because the concept of ‘required\' was added long after the data model and syntax mechanism was designed. It is handled at a later stage by applying business rules built into the software. These templates are used by the software to apply syntax checks. We don\'t want to document them in a way that is significantly different to the way the software applies them. We want to make it clear that there is a difference between purely ‘optional\' and ‘required\'.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Description of Attributes Common to all Objects\n\n * "org:" – this optional attribute references the primary key, or id, of an organisation object that currently exists in the database. The referenced object contains details of the organisation that holds Internet resources or secondary objects to help manage resources in the RIPE Database or specifies business relations. This attribute is required on the inet(6)num objects with the following status values:\n   \n   * ALLOCATED-BY-RIR\n   * ALLOCATED PA\n   * ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\n   * ALLOCATED PI\n   * ALLOCATED UNESPECIFIED\n\n * "admin-c:" – this attribute is optional in some objects and mandatory in others. It references the primary key, or NIC Handle, of either a role or person object. It should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object. The reference must be the contact details of an on-site administrative contact. This contact may be a single person, or it may be a role within the organisation that more than one person takes on. These people may or may not be listed in the role object.\n\n * "tech-c:" – this attribute is optional in some objects and mandatory in others. It references the primary key, or Nic Handle, of either a role or person object. It should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object. The reference must be the contact details of a technical contact. This contact may be a single person, or it may be a role within the organisation that more than one person takes on. These people may or may not be listed in the role object.\n\n * "remarks:" – this optional attribute can be any free format text, within the allowable encoding. This attribute can even have a blank value and be used as a spacer to separate different parts of the information in an object. Some objects have very complex arrangements in their remarks with lots of formatting and style to create a layout that almost personalises their data. Keep in mind that it is data and the RIPE Database is not the best place to display ASCII art. The best advice on using remarks is to ‘keep it simple\'.\n\n * "notify:" – this optional attribute specifies an email address to which notifications of changes to an object will be sent. Only the email addresses from the "notify:" attribute values contained in ‘this\' object will be notified of changes to ‘this\' object. Only successful changes will be notified. Within the RIPE NCC, we can override this notification mechanism. For example, if the community agrees on a syntax change that affects many objects in the database, this change may be done as a bulk update by the RIPE NCC. In some cases, the RIPE NCC does not want to trigger hundreds of thousands or even millions of emails to be sent as part of the implementation of an agreed change.\n\n * "mnt-by:" – this mandatory attribute references the primary key, or name, of a mntner object that currently exists in the database. This mntner object\'s credentials must authorise any operations performed on the object that contains this attribute. The mntner object must exist in the database before it can be referenced in other objects. In some objects, the mntner object referenced in a "mnt-by:" attribute can have a range of additional powers. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'. When this applies, it will be stated in the object template descriptions.\n\n * "created:" – This attribute reflects when the object was created in the RIPE Database. Because a large number of objects were imported in bulk from a previous incarnation of the RIPE Database on 21 September 2001, the actual "created" time for these objects can be very difficult or impossible to find. Because ISO 8601 does not support an "undefined" notation, the following date and time is used: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\n\n * "last-modified:" – This attribute reflects when it was last changed. If an object has never been changed, the value of this attribute will be the same as the "created:" attribute. If an object was part of the bulk import on 21 September 2001 and has never been modified, the original import date and time was used for this attribute. This attribute will not be modified as a result of bulk changes, applied to the database by the RIPE NCC, that have no semantic meaning. An example of this is when an attribute is deprecated and removed from all objects containing it.\n\n * "source:" – The "source:" attribute should specify the authoritative registry where the object is registered. In the RIPE Database, all source values are set to ‘RIPE\'. The same value is used even when the object is a copy of a resource from another registry. The source may be appended with a software-generated end-of-line comment ‘# Filtered\'. This is not part of the stored data. It may be generated when the object is displayed, depending on the query flags used. (Note that users cannot add end-of-line comments to a source attribute. Please see \'End of Line Comments\' for more information.) For the RIPE TEST Database the source value is ‘TEST\' for all objects. This may also be appended with ‘# Filtered\'. For the Global Resource Service (GRS), the RIPE NCC mirrors several other resource databases. The source value reflects which of the mirrored databases returned the query result. For example ‘APNIC-GRS\' if the queried resource was found in the mirror of the APNIC Database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Descriptions of Primary Objects\n\n * Description of the AUT-NUM Object\n * Description of the DOMAIN Object\n * Description of the INET6NUM Object\n * Description of the INETNUM Object\n * Description of the ROUTE Object\n * Description of the ROUTE6 Object\n * Description of the AS-SET Object\n * Description of the FILTER-SET Object\n * Description of the INET-RTR Object\n * Description of the PEERING-SET Object\n * Description of the ROUTE-SET Object\n * Description of the RTR-SET Object\n\n\n# Description of the AUT-NUM Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the aut-num object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name   Presence   Repeat     Indexed \naut-num:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup\nas-name:         mandatory  single    \ndescr:           optional   multiple  \nmember-of:       optional   multiple   inverse\nimport-via:      optional   multiple  \nimport:          optional   multiple  \nmp-import:       optional   multiple  \nexport-via:      optional   multiple  \nexport:          optional   multiple  \nmp-export:       optional   multiple  \ndefault:         optional   multiple  \nmp-default:      optional   multiple  \nremarks:         optional   multiple  \norg:             optional   single     inverse\nsponsoring-org:  optional   single     inverse\nadmin-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse\ntech-c:          mandatory  multiple   inverse\nabuse-c:         optional   single     inverse\nstatus:          generated  single    \nnotify:          optional   multiple   inverse\nmnt-by:          mandatory  multiple   inverse\ncreated:         generated  single\nlast-modified:   generated  single\nsource:          mandatory  single  \n\n\nThe aut-num object serves a dual purpose in the database. As part of the RIPE Internet Number Registry, it contains the registration details of an Autonomous System Number (ASN) resource assigned by the RIPE NCC. As part of an Internet Routing Registry, it allows routing policies to be published. It refers to a group of IP networks that have a single and clearly defined external routing policy, operated by one or more network operators – an Autonomous System (AS). This is the only primary object that crosses over between these two registries in the RIPE Database.\n\nBecause of this crossover between the two registries contained within the RIPE Database, authorisation for creation of route(6) objects can and must be provided by both the address space holder and the holder of the AS number. For more details, see the section \'Authorisation\'.\n\nThe number part of an ASN is a 32-bit number. Historically, these were 16-bit numbers. But when the pool of available numbers was running low, they were extended to 32 bits. In theory, there is no difference between a 16-bit ASN and a 32-bit ASN, except perhaps the size of the number. One is just a subset of the other. For technical reasons, some users still prefer a 16-bit ASN.\n\nThe primary key value will be in this format:\n\n‘ASn\' where ‘n\' is a 32-bit unsigned, number in the range 0: 4,294,967,295.\n\nLeading zeroes (AS065536) are not allowed and will be removed (AS65536) by the database software.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the AUT-NUM Object\n\n * "aut-num:" – the registered AS Number of the Autonomous System (AS) that this object describes. It must start with the two letters ‘AS\'.\n * "as-name:" – a symbolic name of the AS. Must be a single word of letters, numbers and the characters ‘-‘ and ‘_\'.\n * "descr:" - A short description related to the object.\n * "member-of:" - references a set object that this AS wants to be a member of. This membership claim must be acknowledged by a respective "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * "import:", "export:" and "default:" - specify the IPv4 routing policies of the AS.\n * "import-via:" and "export-via:" - specify routing policies regarding non-adjacent networks. These attributes help participants of Multi-Lateral Peering services to inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be applied towards other participants.\n * "mp-import:", "mp-export:" and "mp-default:" - specify IPv4, IPv6 and multicast routing policies.\n * "org:" – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. This is a required attribute in the aut-num object. If the "status:" value is ‘ASSIGNED\' then the object must have an "org:" attribute.\n * "sponsoring-org:" – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. This value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. If a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. The aut-num object in the RIPE Database will then be synchronised with the changes. A user cannot set, remove or change this value. An aut-num object can be created without this attribute. But the RIPE NCC can remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * "status:" – There are three different categories of aut-num objects in the RIPE Database. This generated "status:" attribute clearly shows which category an aut-num object belongs to. The categories are:\n   * ‘ASSIGNED\', - all AS Number resources assigned by the RIPE NCC\n   * ‘LEGACY\' - all legacy AS Numbers used within the RIPE region but not assigned by the RIPE NCC\n   * ‘OTHER\' – any aut-num that is not one of the above, typically a non-authoritative copy of an aut-num from another RIR region used for routing authentication in the RIPE Database A user cannot set, remove or change this value. It is determined from the status noted for this resource in the registry information and set by the software when the object is updated. An update to an aut-num object will never fail because of a missing "status:" attribute or incorrect value. The software will add or correct it. The status of an aut-num is only administrative. It does not affect the usage of an aut-num for any routing purpose or impact certification in any way.\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. If present, this overrides any existing reference on a referenced organisation object. This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “mnt-by:” – This attribute may have extra powers in addition to its default behaviour. In the absence of any “mnt-routes:” attributes, the mntner objects listed in the “mnt-by:” attributes can authorise the creation of route(6) objects originated by this AS number. For more details, see the section \'Authorisation\'.\n\n\n# Description of the DOMAIN Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the domain object. It lists all possible attributes allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence       Repeat       Indexed\ndomain:           mandatory      single       primary/lookup\ndescr:            optional       multiple\norg:              optional       multiple     inverse\nadmin-c:          mandatory      multiple     inverse\ntech-c:           mandatory      multiple     inverse\nzone-c:           mandatory      multiple     inverse\nnserver:          mandatory      multiple     inverse\nds-rdata:         optional       multiple     inverse\nremarks:          optional       multiple\nnotify:           optional       multiple     inverse\nmnt-by:           mandatory      multiple     inverse\ncreated:          generated      single\nlast-modified:    generated      single\nsource:           mandatory      single\n\n\nThe domain object is mainly for registering reverse delegations (number-to-name translations) in both the RIPE Database and the DNS zone files. The RIPE Database is used as the management database for producing the DNS zones. No forward domain names are stored in the RIPE Database. IANA provides information about forward domains.\n\nReverse DNS delegations allow applications to map to a domain name from an IP address. Reverse delegation is achieved by use of the special domain names in-addr.arpa (IPv4) and ip6.arpa (IPv6).\n\nThe domain object is also used for registering ENUM delegations using the domain name e164.arpa.\n\nFor IPv4 addresses, a dash is allowed in the fourth octet of the reverse address. This allows for reverse DNS delegations for address space that doesn\'t fall on octet boundaries as specified in RFC 2317. A dash is not allowed in any other octet. For example:\n\nIPv4 address range\n10.2.1.6 - 10.2.1.25\n\nreverse delegation\n6-25.1.2.10.in-addr.arpa\n\n\nThis is created in the RIPE Database as a single object, including the dash in the range. The DNS provisioning software handles the dash notation and propagates this delegation to the zone file. The range 0-255 is a special case and is not allowed in the fourth octet. Modification and deletion can be performed on this single object in the database. Any change is propagated into the zone file by the DNS provisioning software.\n\nReverse DNS zones in the RIPE Database do not allow child objects. From a DNS view, only the parent object is effective. Business rules in the database software check for hierarchies when a reverse domain object is being created. If either a less or more specific domain object already exists, the creation of the new object is rejected.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the DOMAIN Object\n\n * “domain:” - This is the reverse delegation address or range. It can be for IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or an ENUM phone number. If a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record.\n * “descr:” - A short description related to the object.\n * “zone-c:” - This attribute references the primary key, or NIC Handle, of either a role or person object. It should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object.\n * “nserver:” - The "nserver:" attributes in each domain object define the officially delegated DNS nameservers (the ‘NS\' in DNS zone contents). If a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record. The nameserver name can optionally be followed by an IPv4 or IPv6 address as a glue record.\n * “ds-rdata:” – This attribute holds information about a signed delegation record for DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In DNSSEC the Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record is created from a DNSKEY Resource Record by comparing it with the public key. The parent publishes the DS Resource Record. The "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the RDATA of the DS Resource Records related to the domain (as shown in the "domain:" attribute). ds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278BF194C29A812B33935BB2517E17D1486210FA The tools provided with BIND (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. Before an update, you can copy the DS Rdata into the attributes.\n\n\n# Description of the INET6NUM Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the inet6num object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence    Repeat     Indexed\ninet6num:         mandatory   single     primary/lookup key\nnetname:          mandatory   single     lookup key\ndescr:            optional    multiple  \ncountry:          mandatory   multiple  \ngeofeed:          optional    single\ngeoloc:           optional    single    \nlanguage:         optional    multiple  \norg:              optional    single     inverse key\nsponsoring-org:   optional    single    \nadmin-c:          mandatory   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:           mandatory   multiple   inverse key\nabuse-c:          optional    single     inverse key\nstatus:           mandatory   single    \nassignment-size:  optional    single    \nremarks:          optional    multiple  \nnotify:           optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:           mandatory   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:        optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-routes:       optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-domains:      optional    multiple   inverse key\nmnt-irt:          optional    multiple   inverse key\ncreated:          generated   single\nlast-modified:    generated   single\nsource:           mandatory   single\n\n\nAn inet6num object contains information on allocations and assignments of IPv6 address space resources. This is one of the main elements of the RIPE Internet Number Registry.\n\nHierarchy of INET6NUM Objects\n\nThe inet6num objects cover many different types of data in the RIPE Database. The policy on issuing IPv6 addresses in the RIPE NCC service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses. This policy has changed a number of times over the years and some of the data in the RIPE Database was set up under previous policy conditions. The following paragraphs try to outline how this physical data in the RIPE Database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nThey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object ::/0. This root object is there for data management reasons. It does not mean the RIPE NCC has any administrative authority over the whole IPv6 address space.\n\nThe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the blocks of address space that the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible for. Most allocations to members are from the placeholder objects. However, there are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object. All of these objects, from the root object down to and including the allocations to members, have the same status value of ‘ALLOCATED-BY-RIR\'. There are no differences in the status to distinguish between blocks allocated by IANA to the RIPE NCC and allocations made by the RIPE NCC to members. For this you need to look at the “mnt-lower:”. For the blocks allocated by IANA to the RIPE NCC, the “mnt-lower:” has a RIPE NCC mntner, or it has no “mnt-lower:” which defaults to the “mnt-by:”. For allocations made from these administrative blocks to members, the “mnt-lower:” has the member\'s mntner. Some objects also include remarks highlighting that they are allocations from IANA to the RIPE NCC.\n\nRIPE NCC also makes assignments to end users and TLD operators from the placeholder administrative objects. These are recognised by the “status:” and the “mnt-by:”. In most cases, these assignments will have the status ‘ASSIGNED PI\' or ‘ASSIGNED ANYCAST\'. Some of the earlier direct assignments still have the status ‘ASSIGNED\'. These can still be recognised, as they should have a RIPE NCC mntner as one of the joint “mnt-by:” attributes.\n\nWithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. They all have a placeholder object as their parent. All of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. Although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inet6num object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nThe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. These are jointly managed by the RIPE NCC and either the End User or the sponsoring organisation. The sponsoring organisation is a RIPE NCC member who handles the End User\'s administration for this resource with the RIPE NCC.\n\nAn assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. There can be no more specific objects. For the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. All objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the RIPE Database by the member organisation, not by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or the member can create an aggregation object with part of the allocation. Assignments of a fixed size will be made from this aggregation object. Finally, any part of the address space may be assigned to an End User. Again, the assignment is the lowest level, or an end point, for that part of the hierarchy. All of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the INET6NUM Object\n\n * “inet6num:” – This specifies a block of IPv6 addresses that the inet6num object presents. The block may be one or more addresses. Addresses can only be expressed in a prefix notation. The prefix is converted to a canonical format where necessary and an informational message will be returned to the user if this conversion is done. The format expresses addresses as a 128-bit number in hexadecimal groups of two bytes with colon separators between the groups . There is the possibility of using a shorthand notation for strings of consecutive zeros. Leading zeros from any two-byte group will be removed by the software. In this case, an informational message will be returned to the user.\n * “netname:” – This is a name given to a range of IP address space. A netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. The first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. It is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “country:” – This identifies a country using the ISO 3166 2-letter country codes. It has never been specified what this country represents. It could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company, where the server centre is based, or the home of the End User. Therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map IP addresses to countries.\n * "geofeed:" – Contains a URL referencing a CSV file containing geolocation data for the resource. The geofeed format is defined in RFC 8805.\n * “geoloc:” – The geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. Format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. Latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. All more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “language:” – Identifies the language as a two-letter code from the ISO 639-1 language code list. All more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “org:” – single valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. This is a required attribute. In some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. If the inet6num object is (jointly) maintained by the RIPE NCC then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. If a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. The inet6num object in the RIPE Database will then be synchronised with the changes. A user cannot set, remove or change this value. An inet6num object can be created without this attribute. The software will generate the correct value if it is required. The RIPE NCC will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. If present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “status:” – The status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inet6num object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. It can not be changed after creating the object and it can take one of these values:\n   * ALLOCATED-BY-RIR – This is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible and allocations made to members by the RIPE NCC.\n   * ALLOCATED-BY-LIR – This is equivalent to the inetnum status ‘SUB-ALLOCATED PA\'. A member can sub-allocate part of an allocation to another organisation. The other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. However, the RIPE NCC member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if some parts of it have been sub-allocated to another organisation. Provisions have been built in to the RIPE Database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space. Within such allocation, it is still required to document assignments using the status "AGGREGATED-BY-LIR" or "ASSIGNED". With the inet6num object there is no equivalent to the inetnum ‘LIR-PARTITIONED\' status values allowing partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * AGGREGATED-BY-LIR – With IPv6, it is not necessary to document each individual End User assignment in the RIPE Database. If you have a group of End Users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /56, then you can create a large, single block with this status. The “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the End User blocks. All assignments made from this block must have that size. It is possible to have two levels of ‘AGGREGATED-BY-LIR\'. The "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inet6num object has been created.\n   * ASSIGNED – These are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an End User.\n   * ASSIGNED PI – These are assignments made by the RIPE NCC directly to an End User. In most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the End User. The sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the RIPE Database for the End User.\n   * ASSIGNED ANYCAST – This address space has been assigned for use in TLD anycast networks.\n * “assignment-size:” – This specifies the common size of all individual assignments aggregated into one block with the status ‘AGGREGATED-BY-LIR\'. This attribute is required to be present if the inet6num object has this status. The individual assignments do not need to be represented in the RIPE Database. But one or more assignments may be included if the member wishes to specify them for any reason. The maximum assignment size is 128.\n * “mnt-lower:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the inet6num with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-domains:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inet6num with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. Depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inet6num and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-routes:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route6 object creation. Authorisation for route6 object creation is the most complex. This is explained in more detail in the section \'Authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-irt:” – Despite its name, this attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. It references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. Authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. These references apply in a hierarchical way. So where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inet6num object inherit the reference.\n\n\n# Description of the INETNUM Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the inetnum object.

This is one of the main elements of the RIPE Internet Number Registry.\n\nHierarchy of INETNUM Objects\n\nThe inetnum objects cover many different types of data in the RIPE Database. The policy on issuing IPv4 addresses in the RIPE NCC service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses within the region. This policy has changed many times over the years. Some of the data in the RIPE Database was set up under previous policy conditions. The following paragraphs outline how this physical data in the RIPE Database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nThey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object 0/0. This root object is there for data management reasons. It does not mean the RIPE NCC has any administrative authority over the whole IPv4 address space.\n\nThe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the /8 ranges of address space that the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible for. There are also top-level legacy objects. These are outside the administrative control of the RIPE NCC but still used by resource holders within the RIPE NCC service region. These are generally smaller than a /8 but hierarchically on the same level. In other words, the root object is the parent of all the top-level legacy objects and these /8 placeholder objects. There may be other placeholder objects outside these /8 objects for historical reasons. These will be cleaned up at some point in the future. There are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object.\n\nThe different types of data can be recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. The root object and all the placeholder objects will have a status ‘ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\'. But some of the member allocations may also have this status. If it has this status and has a RIPE NCC mntner as the “mnt-lower:”, then it is an administrative block. All the legacy objects will have the status ‘LEGACY\'.\n\nThe RIPE NCC has directly issued address space to its members and End Users from the placeholder administrative objects. Again, these are recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. Most allocations to members have a status ‘ALLOCATED PA\'. But a few will also have the status ‘ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\'. They will all have the members mntner as “mnt-lower:”. The assignments made by the RIPE NCC will have a status ‘ASSIGNED PI\' or ‘ASSIGNED ANYCAST\'. An allocation can also contain a single assignment with the same prefix length as the allocation, this combined object has the status \'ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\'.\n\nWithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. They all have the placeholder objects as their parent. All of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. Although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inetnum object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nThe member allocation objects are partly managed by the RIPE NCC and partly by the member. Because of this joint management, there are two maintainers on the object as the “mnt-by:” - these are the RIPE NCC maintainer and the LIR\'s default maintainer. If no default maintainer is present yet, the LIR must select it on the LIR Portal account details page. After doing this, the default maintainer will be reflected on all existing and new objects that have joint responsibility. Business rules determine which attributes can only be changed by the RIPE NCC and which ones can be changed by the LIR.\n\nThe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. These are jointly managed by the RIPE NCC and either the End User or the sponsoring organisation. The sponsoring organisation is a RIPE NCC member who handles the End User\'s administration for this resource with the RIPE NCC.\n\nAn assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. There can be no more specific objects. For the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. All objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the RIPE Database by the member organisation, not by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or part of it can be sub-allocated to another organisation. Finally, any part of it may be assigned to an End User. Again, the assignment is the lowest level or end point for that part of the hierarchy. All of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\nThe top-level legacy objects are also jointly managed by the resource holder and the RIPE NCC. Some values in these objects have business rules preventing the resource holder from changing the values. All other parts of the object can be edited in the same way as any other object. Below the top-level legacy object, the resource holder can create as many levels of hierarchy as they wish. All the objects in this legacy hierarchy will have the same status value of ‘LEGACY\'. So it is not possible to identify, for example, sub-allocations or assignments in the legacy hierarchy by status.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the INETNUM Object\n\n * “inetnum:” – This specifies a range of IPv4 addresses that the inetnum object presents. The range may be one or more addresses.\n\nAddresses can be expressed in either range or prefix notation. If prefix notation is used, the software will convert this to range notation and an informational message will be returned to the user. The end address must always be greater than or equal to the start address.\n\nThe range notation expresses addresses as 32-bit whole numbers in dotted quad notation. Leading zeros from any quad will be removed by the software and an informational message will be returned to the user.\n\n * “netname:” – This is a name given to a range of IP address space. A netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. The first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. It is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n\n * “descr:” - A short description related to the object.\n\n * “country:” – This identifies a country using the ISO 3166-2 letter country codes. It has never been specified what this country represents. It could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company or where the server centre is based or the home of the End User. Therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map IP addresses to countries.\n\n * "geofeed:" - Contains a URL referencing a CSV file containing geolocation data for the resource. The geofeed format is defined in RFC 8805.\n\n * “geoloc:” - The geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. Format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. Latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. All more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “language:” - Identifies the language as a two-letter code from the ISO 639-1 language code list. All more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “org:” – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. This is a required attribute. In some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. If the inetnum object is (jointly) maintained by the RIPE NCC then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. This value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. If a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. The inetnum object in the RIPE Database will then be synchronised with the changes. A user cannot set, remove or change this value. An inetnum object can be created without this attribute. The software will generate the correct value if it is required. The RIPE NCC will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. If present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or * "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n\n * “status:” – The status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inetnum object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. It can take one of these values:\n   \n   * ‘ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED\' – This is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible. Historically, a small number of allocations made to members have this status also.\n   * ‘ALLOCATED PA\' – These are allocations made to members by the RIPE NCC.\n   * \'ALLOCATED-ASSIGNED PA\' - An allocation with a single assignment of the same prefix length.\n   * AGGREGATED-BY-LIR – It is not necessary to document each individual End User assignment in the RIPE Database. If you have a group of End Users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /24, then you can create a large, single block with this status. The “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the End User blocks. All assignments made from this block must have that size. It is possible to have two levels of ‘AGGREGATED-BY-LIR\'. The "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inetnum object has been created.\n   * ‘LIR-PARTITIONED PA\' – This is to allow partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * ‘SUB-ALLOCATED PA\' – A member can sub-allocate a part of an allocation to another organisation. The other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. However, the RIPE NCC member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if parts of it have been sub-allocated. Provisions have been built in to the RIPE Database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space.\n   * ‘ASSIGNED PA\' – These are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an End User.\n   * ‘ASSIGNED PI\' – These are assignments made by the RIPE NCC directly to an End User. In most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the End User. The sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the RIPE Database for the End User.\n   * ‘ASSIGNED ANYCAST\' - This address space has been assigned for use in TLD anycast networks.\n   * ‘LEGACY\' – These are resources that were allocated to users before the RIPE NCC was set up.\n\n * “mnt-lower:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one-level more specific (child) objects to the inetnum with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. This is explained in more detail in the section, \'Authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-domains:” - This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inetnum with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. Depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inetnum and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. This is explained in more detail in the section, \'Authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-routes:” - This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route object creation. Authorisation for route object creation is the most complex. This is explained in more detail in the section, \'Authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-irt:” - This attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. It references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. Authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. These references apply in a hierarchical way. Therefore, where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inetnum object inherit the reference. This is explained in more detail in the section on Abuse Handling.\n\n\n# Description of the ROUTE Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the route object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nroute:          mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple   \norigin:         mandatory  single     primary/inverse key\npingable:       optional   multiple   \nping-hdl:       optional   multiple   inverse key\nholes:          optional   multiple   \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nmember-of:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ninject:         optional   multiple   \naggr-mtd:       optional   single     \naggr-bndry:     optional   single     \nexport-comps:   optional   single     \ncomponents:     optional   single     \nremarks:        optional   multiple   \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-routes:     optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single     \nlast-modified:  generated  single     \nsource:         mandatory  single     \n\n\nA route object contains routing information for IPv4 address space resources. This is one of the main elements of the RIPE Internet Routing Registry.\n\nEach interAS route (also known as an interdomain route) originated by an Autonomous System can be specified by using a route object for IPv4 addresses.\n\nAuthorisation for creating route objects is quite complex. There are multiple scenarios depending on who administers the address space. Because the RIPE INR and IRR are part of the same logical database, they can both be used for authorisation if the address space is RIPE NCC administered resources. For more details on this see the section, \'Authorisation\'.\n\nPlease refer to RFC 2622 for more information on the specific routing information attributes in the route object.\n\nThe route consistency can be checked using the AS routing consistency tool. This wizard compares the actual state of the Internet Routing tables (collected by RIS), in order to identify and correct possible inconsistencies in the RIPE Database.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ROUTE Object\n\n * “route:” – This specifies the IPv4 address prefix of the route. Together with the "origin:" attribute, these constitute a combined primary key of the route object. The address can only be specified as a prefix. It can be one or more IP addresses.\n * “descr:” - A short description related to the object.\n * “origin:” - AS Number of the Autonomous System that originates the route into the interAS routing system. The corresponding aut-num object for this Autonomous System may not exist in the RIPE Database.\n * “pingable:” - Allows a network operator to advertise an IP address of a node that should be reachable from outside networks. This node can be used as a destination address for diagnostic tests. The IP address must be within the address range of the route object containing this attribute.\n * “ping-hdl:” - References a person or role capable of responding to queries concerning the IP address(es) specified in the \'pingable\' attribute.\n * “holes:” – These attributes form a list of the component address prefixes that are not reachable through the aggregate route (that part of the address space is possibly unallocated).\n * “member-of:” – This attribute identifies a set object that this route object wants to be a member of. This membership claim, however, should be acknowledged by a corresponding "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * “inject:” – These attributes specify which routers perform the aggregation and when they perform it.\n * “aggr-mtd:” – This attribute specifies how the aggregate is generated.\n * “aggr-bndry:” – This attribute defines a set of Autonomous Systems, which form the aggregation boundary.\n * “export-comps:” – This attribute defines the set\'s policy filter, a logical expression which, when applied to a set of routes, returns a subset of these routes.\n * “components:” – This attribute defines the component routes used to form the aggregate.\n * “mnt-lower:” - Provides a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. These tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the route with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. This is only used if the parent route object does not contain an “mnt-routes:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-routes:” or “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. For more details see the section on authorisation.\n * “mnt-routes:” - Provides a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for exact match or more specific route object creation. For an exact match route object- if there is no “mnt-routes:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” is used. For a more specific route object the “mnt-lower may also be used, if present. The "mnt-routes:" attribute can include an optional list of prefix ranges inside curly brackets ("{}") or the keyword "ANY". This should follow the reference to the maintainer. The default, when no additional set items are specified, is "ANY" or all more specifics.\n\n\n# Description of the ROUTE6 Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the route6 object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nroute6:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \norigin:         mandatory  single     primary/inverse key\npingable:       optional   multiple  \nping-hdl:       optional   multiple   inverse key\nholes:          optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nmember-of:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ninject:         optional   multiple  \naggr-mtd:       optional   single    \naggr-bndry:     optional   single    \nexport-comps:   optional   single    \ncomponents:     optional   single    \nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-routes:     optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single \n\n\nA route6 object contains routing information for IPv6 address space resources.

This is only used if the parent route6 object does not contain an “mnt-routes:” attribute. If there is no “mnt-routes:” or “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects.

An as-set object forms a set of AS Numbers that can be referenced in many of the places where an AS Number reference can be used. Sets can be built with hierarchical names and can also include direct references to other sets. References can also be made indirectly by using the “mbrs-by-ref:” attribute. For more details see the section about sets.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the AS-SET Object\n\n * “as-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘as-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be an as-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name have to be as-set names. For more details see the section on sets.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “members:” – These attributes list the direct members of the set. They can be either lists of AS Numbers, or other as-set names.\n * “mbrs-by-ref:” – These attributes can be used in all set objects. They allow indirect population of a set. If this attribute is used, the set also includes objects of the corresponding type (aut-num objects for as-set, for example) that are protected by one of these maintainers and whose "member-of:" attributes refer to the name of the set. If the value of a "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is ANY, any object of the corresponding type referring to the set is a member of the set. If there are no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the set is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes. For more details see the section about sets.\n * “mnt-lower:” – When creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present. Otherwise the “mnt-by:” mntner objects can be used for authorisation.

It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nfilter-set:     mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple\nfilter:         optional   single  \nmp-filter:      optional   single     \nremarks:        optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-lower:      optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single \n\n\nTo specify routing policies, it is often useful to define sets of objects. A filter-set object defines a set of routes that match the criteria that you specify in your \'filter\' – in other words, it filters out the routes that you do not want to see. The policy filter can match routes using any BGP path attribute, such as the destination address prefix, AS-path, or community attributes. Although the “filter:” and “mp-filter:” attributes are ‘single\', they can be composite by using the operators AND, OR, and NOT.\n\nSets can be built with hierarchical names. Unlike other set objects the filter-set object does not include the “members:” or "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the FILTER-SET Object\n\n * “filter-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘fltr-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be a filter-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name must be filter-set names. For more details, see the section about sets.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “filter:” – This attribute defines the policy filter of the set. This is a logical expression which, when applied to a set of routes, returns a subset of these routes. These are the ones that you want to filter in or filter out. A filter-set object is required by business rules to include either a “filter:” or an “mp-filter:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n * “mp-filter:” – This attribute extends the "filter:" attribute to allow you to specify IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes and prefix ranges. A filter-set object is required by business rules to include either a “filter:” or an “mp-filter:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n * “mnt-lower:” – When creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present, otherwise they can be authorised by “mnt-by:” mntner objects. For more details see the section about sets.\n\n\n# Description of the INET-RTR Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the inet-rtr object.

Canonical DNS name aliases can be set up as well as specifying which AS Number owns/operates the router.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the INET-RTR Object\n\n * “inet-rtr:” – This attribute is a valid DNS name of the router described by this object. It cannot end with a dot.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “alias:” – Each optional “alias:” attribute is a canonical DNS name for the router.\n * “local-as:” – This attribute specifies the AS Number of the AS which owns/operates this router.\n * “ifaddr:” - This attribute specifies the interface address and mask length within an Internet router, as well as an optional action to set other parameters on this interface.\n * “interface:” – This attribute specifies an interface address, This can be multi-protocol. It can have an optional action, examples being RPSL preferences, prepending and MED. Also an optional tunnel definition can be included.\n * “peer:” – This attribute specifies the details of any interior or exterior router peering. This can be specified using either an IP address of the peer router or its inet-rtr name. A group of peers can be specified using an rtr-set name or a peering-set name. If peering-set name form is used, only the peerings in the corresponding peering set that are with this router are included.\n * “mp-peer:” – This attribute extends the "peer:" attribute to support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n * “member-of:” - references a set object that this router wants to be a member of. This membership claim must be acknowledged by a respective "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n\n\n# Description of the PEERING-SET Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the peering-set object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.

A peering-set object defines a set of peerings that you specify in the “peering:” or “mp-peering:” attribute. It identifies all the peerings between a (set of) local routers and a (set of) peer routers. Although the “peering:” and “mp-peering:” attributes are ‘single\', they can be composite by using the operators AND, OR, and EXCEPT. EXCEPT is equivalent to ‘AND NOT\'.\n\nSets can be built with hierarchical names. Unlike other set objects the peering-set object does not include the “members:” or "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the PEERING-SET Object\n\n * “peering-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘prng-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be a peering-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name have to be peering-set names. For more details see the section \'Set Objects\'.\n\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n\n * “peering:” – This attribute defines a peering that you can use to import or export routes. A peering-set object is required by business rules to include either a “peering:” or an “mp-peering:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n\n * “mp-peering:” – This attribute extends the "peering:" attribute to allow you to specify IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes and prefix ranges. A peering-set object is required by business rules to include either a “peering:” or an “mp-peering:” attribute. One of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n\n * “mnt-lower:” – When creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present, otherwise the “mnt-by:” mntner objects.

Sets can be built with hierarchical names and can also include direct references to other sets. References can also be made indirectly by using the “mbrs-by-ref:” attribute. For more details see the section on Sets.\n\nWhere a route-set is expected (e.g. “members:” attribute of the route-set object), an AS number ASx defines the set of routes that are originated by ASx; and an as-set AS-X defines the set of routes that are originated by the ASes in AS-X. A route p is said to be originated by ASx if there is a route object for p, with ASx as the value of the “origin:” attribute.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ROUTE-SET Object\n\n * “route-set:” – This attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘rs-‘. It can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). At least one component must be a route-set name. The others can be more set names or AS Numbers. All the set name components of a hierarchical name have to be route-set names. For more details see the section on Sets.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “members:” – These attributes list the direct members of the set. They can be either address prefixes or ranges, other route-set names, lists of AS Numbers, or as-set names. An address prefix or a route-set name in a members attribute can be optionally followed by a range operator.\n * “mp-members:” – Extends the “members:” attribute to include IPv6 address prefixes.\n * “mbrs-by-ref:” – These attributes can be used in all set objects. They allow indirect population of a set. If this attribute is used, the set also includes objects of the corresponding type (aut-num, route-set or as-set objects for route-set, for example) that are protected by one of these maintainers and whose "member-of:" attributes refer to the name of the set. If the value of a "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is ‘ANY\', any object of the corresponding type referring to the set is a member of the set. If there are no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the set is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes.

Only the RIPE Database Administrators can create as-block objects. The set of as-block objects covers the full range of 16-bit and 32-bit AS Numbers. These objects prevent anyone other than the RIPE Database administrators from creating aut-num objects in the RIPE Database for AS Numbers that are administered by the RIPE NCC. The authorisation is set up so that anyone can create aut-num objects in the RIPE Database as copies of AS Numbers administered by other RIRs.\n\nThe primary key value will be in this format:\n\n‘ASn - ASm\' where n and m is a 32-bit unsigned, numbers in the range 0: 4,294,967,295. The values of n and m can be the same representing a block of one AS Number.\n\nLeading zeroes (AS1 - AS065536) are not allowed and will be removed (AS1 - AS65536) by the database software.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the AS-BLOCK Object\n\n * "as-block:" – the range of AS Numbers covered by this block.\n * "descr:" - A short description related to the object.\n * "mnt-lower:" – This attribute controls who is able to create aut-num objects in the RIPE Database for the range of AS Numbers covered by this as-block object. See the section \'Authorisation\' for more information.\n\n\n# Description of the IRT Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the irt object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name   Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nirt:            mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\naddress:        mandatory  multiple  \nphone:          optional   multiple  \nfax-no:         optional   multiple  \ne-mail:         mandatory  multiple   lookup key\nsignature:      optional   multiple  \nencryption:     optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nauth:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nirt-nfy:        optional   multiple   inverse key\nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single   \n\n\nThe irt object was introduced to represent a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). This object includes security information for use by CSIRT teams as they communicate with each other.\n\nThe irt object may only be referenced from inetnum and inet6num objects to show which CSIRT is responsible for handling computer and network incidents for that address range. Use is made of the hierarchical nature of address space. Any reference in an inet(6)num object to an irt object applies not only to the referencing object but also to all more specific address space. So the more specific objects inherit the reference to the irt object. When querying address space for an irt reference, the query software takes account of this inheritance and queries up the hierarchy looking for the nearest applicable irt object reference. This information is returned when any more specific inet(6)num object is queried. Where irt references are made at multiple points in an address space hierarchy, the closest less specific reference applies.\n\nAdding a reference to an irt object requires authorisation from the maintainer of the irt object. This is handled using the "auth:" attribute of the irt object. Although the reference to an irt object from an inet(6)num object is made using the "mnt-irt:" attribute, it should be clear that the irt object is not a mntner object. The irt object contains contact information and is more similar to a role object than a mntner object.\n\nThe contact details provided by an irt object must be business information and must not contain any personal information.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the IRT Object\n\n * "irt:" – This attribute is a single word name for the response team starting with ‘IRT-‘.\n * "address:" - This is a full postal address for the business contact represented by this irt object.\n * "phone:" – This is a phone number for the business contact represented by this irt object. It specifies a telephone number in international format. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally followed by an extension number.\n * "fax-no:" - This is a fax number for the business contact represented by this irt object.\n * "e-mail:" – This is an email address of a business role, organisation or CSIRT team represented by this irt object.\n * "signature:" – This attribute references a key-cert object in the RIPE Database representing a public key used by the CSIRT team to sign their correspondence.\n * "encryption:" – This attribute references a key-cert object in the RIPE Database representing a public key used to encrypt correspondence sent to the CSIRT team.\n * "auth:" – This attribute defines the authentication scheme to be used to authorise the addition of a reference to this irt object. It has the same authentication options as described in the the sub-section \'Description of the mntner Object\'.\n * "irt-nfy:" – This attribute specifies a business email address to be notified when a reference to this irt object is added or removed.\n * "mnt-ref:" – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this irt object in any other object.\n\n\n# Description of the KEY-CERT Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the key-cert object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nkey-cert:       mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nmethod:         generated  single    \nowner:          generated  multiple  \nfingerpr:       generated  single     inverse key\ncertif:         mandatory  multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single    \n\n\nA key-cert object holds a public key certificate, available by querying the RIPE Database. Anyone who needs to use authorisation in the RIPE Database and who has a private key can store their public key in a key-cert object. It is used with the mntner and irt objects. You cannot create a public/private key pair using the RIPE Database software. You must use some external software to create your keys and then copy the certificate data into the key-cert object.\n\nCurrently, the RIPE Database supports two types of keys, PGP and X.509.\n\nThe PGP certificate can be used to authorise updates to the RIPE Database and for signing and encrypting correspondence with a CSIRT using an irt object (see the sub-sections \'Description of the irt Object\' and ‘Description of the mntner Object\' for more details). The "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘PGP-nnnnnnnn\' where the key-id nnnnnnnn is a hexadecimal number. These keys are compliant with the Open PGP Message Format. PGP keys using an Elliptic Curve algorithm are not currently supported (e.g. Curve 25519, NIST, SECG, ECC Brainpool etc.).\n\nThe X.509 certificate can be used to sign and encrypt correspondence with a CSIRT using an irt object. It may work in some circumstances for authorising updates to the RIPE Database but we cannot guarantee this. The "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘X509-nnn\' where key-id nnn is an integer number starting with 1. If you want to create an X.509 key-cert object you must follow this appendix.\n\nThe "method:", "owner:" and "fingerpr:" attributes are all generated by the software. It is not necessary to include these attributes when you create or modify one of these objects. If any of them are supplied, the software will check the values. If the value is wrong for any reason, the software will replace the supplied values with generated values. In this case, a warning will be returned to the user.\n\nIn case of performing REST updates using this authentication method Client Certificate Authentication API needs to be used.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the KEY-CERT Object\n\n * "key-cert:" – This attribute specifies the key-id. This is used in "auth:" attributes of the mntner and irt objects.\n * "method:" – This attribute defines the type of the public key. Currently, only PGP and X509 are supported.\n * "owner:" – This attribute specifies the owner of the public key. This information must be supplied when you create the key. The RIPE Database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "fingerpr:" – This attribute is an identifier of the public key. The RIPE Database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "certif:" – The value of the public key should be supplied either using multiple "certif:" attributes, or in one "certif:" attribute. In the first case, this is easily done by exporting the key from your local key ring in ASCII-armored format and adding the string "certif:" to the start of each line of the key. In the second case, line continuation should be used to represent an ASCII-armored format of the key. All the lines of the exported key must be included, not forgetting the begin and end markers and the empty line that separates the header from the key body.\n\n\n# Description of the MNTNER Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the mntner object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nmntner:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nupd-to:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-nfy:        optional   multiple   inverse key\nauth:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:        optional   multiple   inverse key \ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single  \n\n\nObjects in the RIPE Database are protected using mntner objects. A mntner object is an anonymous box containing the credentials needed to authorise creation, deletion or modification of any objects that it protects by whomever maintains this data. Currently, these credentials are MD5 passwords or PGP keys or Single Sign-On user names from the RIPE NCC Access system. The syntax also allows for X.509 certificates, but these are not fully implemented throughout the whois software.\n\nObjects are protected by a mntner, if they contain a reference to the mntner in the object. This is done by including a "mnt-by:" attribute. Other "mnt-xxx:" attributes offer hierarchical protection. The "mnt-by:" attribute is mandatory in all object types.\n\nA mntner object can be referenced either as a single mntner or comma-separated list of mntners.\n\nMost users set the "mnt-by:" value in a mntner to reference itself. That makes it maintain itself. But this is not always the case. There are situations where someone wants to control who maintains a set of objects. This can be done by using mnt-a to maintain mnt-b. The object mnt-b contains the credentials to maintain a set of data. These credentials are set up by mnt-a.\n\nTo update an object protected by a mntner the authorisation must be passed from one of the "auth:" values in the mntner object referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes of the updated object. This means that the correct credential for one of the "auth:" values must be supplied as part of the update. If an object references more than one mntner in the "mnt-by:" attributes, they act as a logical \'OR\'. If the authorisation is passed by any "auth:" value from any of the referenced *mntner objects, then the update will be authorised.\n\nThe "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attributes all provide for hierarchical authorisation. These also work in a logical \'OR\' when multiple values are included in an object. How they are used is described in the object descriptions where these attributes are valid.\n\nFor more detailed information about using mntner attributes, see the section ‘Authorisation\'.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the MNTNER Object\n\n * "mntner:" – This attribute specifies the name of the mntner object. It should end in ‘-mnt\', but the software has never enforced this.\n * "descr:" – A short description related to the object.\n * "upd-to:" – This attribute specifies an email address where a notification will be sent when an attempt to update an object protected by this mntner is unsuccessful due to authorisation failure. If there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-nfy:" – This attribute specifies the email address where a notification will be sent when an object protected by this mntner is successfully updated. If there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-ref:" – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this mntner object in any other object.\n * "auth:" – This attribute defines an authentication scheme to be used. Any of the current authentication schemes used by the RIPE Database are allowed.\n\n\n# Description of the ORGANISATION Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the organisation object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence   Repeat     Indexed\norganisation:     mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\norg-name:         mandatory  single     lookup key\norg-type:         mandatory  single    \ndescr:            optional   multiple  \nremarks:          optional   multiple  \naddress:          mandatory  multiple \ncountry:          optional   single \nphone:            optional   multiple  \nfax-no:           optional   multiple  \ne-mail:           mandatory  multiple   lookup key\ngeoloc:           optional   single    \nlanguage:         optional   multiple  \norg:              optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:          optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:           optional   multiple   inverse key\nabuse-c:          optional   single     inverse key\nref-nfy:          optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:          mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nnotify:           optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\ncreated:          generated  single\nlast-modified:    generated  single\nsource:           mandatory  single   \n\n\nThe organisation object provides information about an organisation that has registered an Internet resource in the RIPE Database. This may be a company, non-profit group or individual. It was introduced as a means to link together all of the human and Internet resources related to one organisation.\n\nThis object is the central starting point for managing data in the RIPE Database. All your other objects are related to this object. If you manage any aspect of any resource then you should have an organisation object so that other people know who you are, what you maintain and how to contact you.\n\nThe organisation object should only contain business information. Even if the organisation is an individual, it should not include any personal information.\n\nAdding references to an organisation object requires authorisation from the organisation. Removing them does not need any authorisation. The maintainer of the organisation object can choose to be notified when any reference is added or removed.\n\nThis object is created for new members by the RIPE NCC with "org-type: LIR". These objects are required to include an "abuse-c:" attribute referencing an abuse contact object.\n\nThe member organisation objects are partly managed by the RIPE NCC and partly by the member. Because of this joint management, with the RIPE NCC mntner as the "mnt-by:", these objects are locked out of normal updates by members. The parts that the member can change can only be edited in the LIR Portal Object Editors.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ORGANISATION Object\n\n * "organisation:" – This attribute specifies the ID of an organisation object. When creating an object, you must specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value of the attribute to "AUTO-1" or "AUTO-1<letterCombination>" ,so the database will assign the ID automatically. The ID will always start with the string ‘ORG-‘ prefix, followed by 2 to 4 letters, digits, a dash and the database source. If deleted, it is not possible to recreate an organisation object with the same ID.\n * “org-name:” – This attribute specifies the name of the organisation that this organisation object represents in the RIPE Database.\n * “org-type:” – This attribute specifies the type of the organisation. It takes one of the following fixed values. Uses can only create organisation objects with the type ‘OTHER\'. The rest of the values can only be set by the RIPE NCC.\n   * \'IANA\' – Only used for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n   * \'RIR\' – Only used for the five Regional Internet Registries\n   * \'NIR\' – This is for National Internet Registries (there are no NIRs in the RIPE NCC service region, but it is used by APNIC)\n   * \'LIR\' – This represents all the Local Internet Registries (the RIPE NCC members)\n   * \'WHITEPAGES\' – A little-used historical idea for people who have a ‘significant\' presence in the industry but who don\'t manage any resources in the RIPE Database.\n   * \'DIRECT_ASSIGNMENT\' – Used for organisations who have a direct contract with RIPE NCC\n   * \'OTHER\' – This represents all organisations that do not fit any of the above categories.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * "country:" - This is the country for the organisation. Can only be added, modified or removed by the RIPE NCC if the organisation is referenced from RIPE NCC (jointly) maintained resources.\n * “phone:” – This is a phone number for the business contact represented by this organisation object. It specifies a telephone number in international shorthand. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – This is a fax number for the business contact represented by this organisation object.\n * “e-mail:” – This is a business email address for the organisation represented by this object.\n * “geoloc:” – The geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. Format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. Latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180].\n * “language:” – Identifies the language as a two-letter code from the ISO 639-1 language code list.\n * “abuse-c:” – This attribute references an abuse contact object. This can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “ref-nfy:” – This attribute specifies an email address where a notification will be sent when a reference to an organisation object is added or removed. If there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * “mnt-ref:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this organisation object in any other object.\n * “address:” – This is a full postal address for the business contact represented by this organisation object.\n\n\n# Description of the PERSON Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the person object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name    Presence   Repeat     Indexed \nperson:           mandatory  single     lookup key\naddress:          mandatory  multiple  \nphone:            mandatory  multiple  \nfax-no:           optional   multiple  \ne-mail:           optional   multiple   lookup key\norg:              optional   multiple   inverse key\nnic-hdl:          mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nremarks:          optional   multiple  \nnotify:           optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:           mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:          optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:          generated  single\nlast-modified:    generated  single\nsource:           mandatory  single  \n\n\nThe person object provides information about a real person. The original intention was that this should only be used for contacts responsible for technical or administrative issues relating to Internet resources registered in the RIPE Database. However, the business model used by many resource holders is to also document End User customers who have been assigned a resource. One of its purposes is defined as a contact database for people who manage resources. It is not easy to distinguish between customers and contacts from the person object, unless it is documented in "remarks:". The person object is the only object in the RIPE Database that should contain any personal information. The "person:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. The name in the "person:" attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nThe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. For these objects the primary key is the "nic-hdl:" attribute. Both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. So it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. The two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. But it is not possible to convert one into the other. It is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nIf a person object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same NIC Handle. This rule was only introduced in 2009. Before that date, the NIC Handles could be re-used. Some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference NIC Handles. A person or role object in the database that currently has that NIC handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this NIC Handle in the historical reference.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the PERSON Object\n\n * "person:" – This attribute specifies the full name of the contact person. It must have at least two words in the name.\n * “address:” – This is a full postal address for the contact represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – This is a phone number for the contact represented by this object. It specifies a telephone number in international format. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number., optionally followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – This is a fax number for the contact represented by this object.\n * “e-mail:” – This is an email address for the contact represented by this object.\n * “nic-hdl:” – This attribute specifies the ID of a person object. When creating an object, you can specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value of the attribute to ‘AUTO-1\' or ‘AUTO-1<letterCombination>\', so the database will assign the ID automatically. If an AUTO ID is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-RIPE\'. If you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. For example DW-RIPE, DW-NL and DW are all valid NIC Handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this person object in any other object.\n\n\n# Description of the POEM Object\n\nBelow shows the object template for the poem object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\npoem:           mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \nform:           mandatory  single     inverse key\ntext:           mandatory  multiple  \nauthor:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  single     inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single  \n\n\nA poem object contains a poem that is submitted by a user. It has no operational use and reflects the humorous side of industry representatives.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the POEM Object\n\n * "poem:" – This attribute specifies the title of the poem.\n * “descr:” – A short description related to the object.\n * “form:” – This attribute specifies the identifier of a registered poem type. These are set by the poetic-form objects.\n * “text:” – This attribute specifies the body of the poem. It must be humorous, but not malicious or insulting. It should be written in the style of the "form:".\n * “author:” – This attribute is the NIC Handle of the person who entered the poem.\n\n\n# Description of the POETIC-FORM Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the poetic-form object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\npoetic-form:    mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \nadmin-c:        mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  single     inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single  \n\n\nA poetic-form object defines the supported poem types. A new ‘poetic form\' must be approved by the community ‘style council\'. For more details, contact the RIPE Database Working Group or RIPE NCC Customer Services.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the POETIC-FORM Object\n\n * "poetic-form:" – This attribute starts with "FORM-". It is followed by the name of an internationally recognised poetic format of humorous writing. For example, limerick or haiku.\n * “descr:” – This attribute describes the style of the poetic form, written in the form style. For example, if it is a FORM-LIMERICK, the description will be written as a limerick.\n * "mnt-by:" - The poetic-form object must contain a single "mnt-by:" attribute. The object must be maintained by RIPE-DBM-MNT.\n\n\n# Description of the ROLE Object\n\nBelow is the object template for the role object. It lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. Required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nAttribute Name  Presence   Repeat     Indexed\nrole:           mandatory  single     lookup key\naddress:        mandatory  multiple  \nphone:          optional   multiple  \nfax-no:         optional   multiple  \ne-mail:         mandatory  multiple   lookup key\norg:            optional   multiple   inverse key\nadmin-c:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ntech-c:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nnic-hdl:        mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\nremarks:        optional   multiple  \nnotify:         optional   multiple   inverse key\nabuse-mailbox:  optional   single     inverse key\nmnt-by:         mandatory  multiple   inverse key\nmnt-ref:        optional   multiple   inverse key\ncreated:        generated  single\nlast-modified:  generated  single\nsource:         mandatory  single   \n\n\nA role object is similar to a person object. However, instead of describing a single person, it describes a role performed by one or more people. This might be a help desk, network monitoring centre, team of system administrators, etc. A role object is useful since often a person performing a specific function may change while the role itself remains.\n\nThe role object should only include business information about the role. It should not contain any personal information, although it can reference person objects. The original intention was that the role object should be used in every other object where contacts are referenced. The person object was only intended to be referenced by the role object. However, business rules were never built into the software to enforce this. As a consequence, the person and role objects have been used inter changeably in almost any situation where contacts are referenced. The "role:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. The name in the “role:” attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nThe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. For these objects the primary key is the “nic-hdl:” attribute. Both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. So it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. The two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. But it is not possible to convert one into the other. It is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nIf a role object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same NIC Handle. This rule was only introduced in 2009. Before that date, the NIC Handles could be re-used. Some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference NIC Handles. A person or role object in the database now with that NIC handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this NIC handle in the historical reference.\n\nReferences to person objects is optional. A help desk can be represented by a role object. The role contains all the details needed to contact the help desk. It may not be necessary to identify the individuals who make up a team to provide support. Anyone with a problem will contact the help desk and ‘someone\' will respond and provide support. Therefore, no person objects need to be referenced by this help desk role object.\n\nDescription of Attributes Specific to the ROLE Object\n\n * "role:" – This attribute specifies a name for the role. As this is business data rather than personal data, the structure of the “role:” value is similar to the “org-name:” in the organisation object.\n * “address:” – This is a full postal address for the role represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – This is a phone number for the role represented by this object. It specifies a telephone number in international shorthand. It must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally be followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – This is a fax number for the role represented by this object.\n * “e-mail:” – This is an email address for the role represented by this object.\n * “abuse-mailbox:” – The role object is the only place that this attribute should be used. It represents the email address to be used when someone wants to report abuse from an Internet resource. A role object with an “abuse-mailbox:” attribute can be referenced by an “abuse-c:” attribute in an organisation object. For more details see the section on Abuse Handling.\n * “nic-hdl:” – This attribute specifies the ID of a role object. When creating an object, you can specify an "AUTO" ID by setting the value of the attribute to ‘AUTO-1\' or ‘AUTO-1<letterCombination>\', so the database will assign the ID automatically. If an AUTO ID is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-RIPE\'. If you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. For example DW-RIPE, DW-NL and DW are all valid NIC handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – This attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this role object in any other object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Set Objects\n\nThroughout this section we have used the as-set object as an example. The same rules apply to all the different set object types.\n\n\n# Creating Set Objects\n\nNewly created as-set names must be hierarchical. The hierarchy consists of a series of other as-set names separated by colons (:). Anything to the left of a colon is considered a parent, anything to the right is considered a child. At each stage, the whole of the hierarchy, including the colons, is considered as a single string that forms an object name. The set hierarchy can optionally start with an AS number reference as the top-level parent.\n\nExisting as-set names can be short (i.e. with a name only, e.g. AS-TEST) or hierarchical (i.e. with a name and AS number reference(s), e.g. AS3333:AS-TEST). It is now mandatory to only use hierarchical names to create an as-set object, so that the creation is authenticated by the AS number holder. This restriction does not apply to the other set types.\n\nAS-LIST1:AS-CUST\n\nAS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC\n\nare both valid AS-SET names\n\nIn each case, the whole string is the name of the as-set. So "AS-LIST1:AS-CUST" is a set name, including the colon :. But also "AS-LIST1" is a set name and this set is the parent of the set "AS-LIST1:AS-CUST".\n\nIn the second case, "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" is a set and it is the child of the set "AS3333:AS-RIPE". The \'parent\' of this set is AS3333, which is an aut-num object and not a set.\n\nFor each new (child) set object in a hierarchy, the immediate parent object must exist at the time of creating the new child set object. This is everything to the left of the last colon in the new child set object name, taken as a single (hierarchical) object name. Only one level of parent is checked. If any of the higher levels of parent objects have been deleted, it will not affect the creation of the new child object. The parent is only needed for authorisation.\n\nTherefore, if we were to create a new set "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS" then the immediate parent object, "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" must exist to authorise the new set creation. However, it does not matter if higher parent objects still exist, like "AS3333:AS-RIPE".\n\nIf an AS number is the first element in the hierarchical set name (the top-level parent) then the corresponding aut-num object must exist in order to create the next level in the hierarchy as this is the parent object. However, it is only needed for authorisation.\n\nTherefore, to create the set "AS3333:AS-RIPE", the aut-num object "AS3333" must exist to provide authorisation.\n\nIf an AS number appears anywhere else in the set name hierarchy it is treated as part of a set name and the aut-num object does not need to exist. You cannot have AS numbers as the first two levels in the name hierarchy. The second level could not be created, as there must be at least one element starting with "AS-" in the set name.\n\nSo "AS3333:AS-RipeOriginAS1" is a valid set name but AS1 is not an aut-num object, it is simply part of this set name.\n\n"AS3333:AS1" is not valid as it does not contain an "AS-" string defining an as-set name.\n\n"AS3333:AS1:AS-CUSTOMERS" is also not valid as it would require "AS3333:AS1" to exist as the parent to authorise the creation of this set.\n\nOnly hierarchical AS-SET objects can be created. If the set name is a single as-set (starting with AS- and with no colons) then it is considered to be non-hierarchical,\n\nThe as-set object can also list members of the set with a "members:" attribute. The as-set and aut-num objects referenced in a "members:" attribute do not need to exist.\n\n\n# Modifying and Deleting Set Objects\n\nAny intermediate set can be deleted from the hierarchy. This includes everything from the highest-level parent (which is a non-hierarchical as-set or aut-num object) to the lowest-level parent (which is everything to the left of the last colon in the name of the lowest level child object).\n\nIn the case of "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS", it is possible to delete any of these individual objects:\n\n"AS3333"\n\n"AS3333:AS-RIPE"\n\n"AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC"\n\nThey can also be recreated, as the check is only that the immediate parent object (to the left hand side of the last colon of the object name being created) exists. It does not check any higher-level parents or any existing child objects (right hand side of the colon). If several intermediate parents have been deleted, they can only be recreated in the correct sequence, starting with the highest level.\n\nIn the case of "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS", suppose we delete: "AS3333" and "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" but not "AS3333:AS-RIPE". We can recreate "AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-APNIC" as its parent object is "AS3333:AS-RIPE" and this object still exists. Authorisation is required from the existing parent object to recreate the child object.\n\nThere is an issue if the top-level parent is an as-set object and it is deleted. Suppose we have the set "AS-RIPE:AS3333:AS-RIPE:AS-CUSTOMERS" and all the parents exist. (Note that this is subtly different to the set object above, as the top-level parent of this set is a set object, not an aut-num object.) We can delete the top-level parent set "AS-RIPE". The remaining sets "AS-RIPE:AS3333" to "AS-RIPE:AS3333:AS-APNIC:AS-CUSTOMERS" are still valid. However, anyone can now recreate the deleted top-level parent set "AS-IX". This has no parent and therefore requires no hierarchical authorisation. This only becomes a problem if the next-level child set is deleted and the user tries to recreate it. Authorisation is now required from the new parent set that is owned by someone else.\n\nIf there are any aut-num objects with "member-of:" attributes referencing an as-set object then this as-set object cannot be deleted. If the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes are removed from the as-set object, it still cannot be deleted if there are any existing "member-of:" references to it.\n\nA "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute can be removed from an as-set object even if there are "member-of:" references to this as-set object. The "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is only needed for validation of an object\'s claim to membership of the set. A modification to an aut-num object with a "member-of:" reference to this as-set object will fail unless the "member-of:" reference is removed from the aut-num object.\n\nThe as-set object can be deleted if it has "members:" listed in the object that do exist. However, if there are "member-of:" references to the set in other objects, this set object cannot be deleted, even if you first remove the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\n\n# The ROUTE-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the route-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include route and route6 objects instead of aut-num object.\n * "member:" attributes include other route-set objects\n * The set name must have an element starting with \'RS-\'\n * The set name can also include AS numbers\n\n\n# The RTR-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the rtr-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include inet-rtr objects instead of aut-num objects.\n * "member:" attributes also include other rtr-set objects\n * The set name must have an element starting with \'RTRS-\'\n * The set name can also include AS numbers\n\n\n# The PEERING-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the peering-set object as to the as-set object\n * There are no "member:" attributes\n * "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes also include other peering-set objects\n * There are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes. Objects referenced in these attributes do not need to exist on creation and can be deleted later\n * The set name must have an element starting with \'PRNG-\'\n * The set name can also include AS numbers\n\n\n# The FILTER-SET Object\n\n * The same rules apply to the filter-set object as to the as-set object\n * There are no "member:" attributes\n * "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes also include other filter-set objects\n * There are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes.

For command-line queries and for API searches, these flags can be used directly. For web queries, some of the flags can be selected by ticking appropriate check boxes, others can be typed as part of the query string. There are some flags that make no sense with web queries and streamed output, for example -k for a persistent connection or –G to turn off grouping, as grouping is disabled by default in the streamed output.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Abuse Contacts\n\nThere are many attributes in objects within the RIPE Database containing e-mail addresses. These addresses cover a number of functions. A growing concern to engineers and administrators that maintain networks is receiving spam and abuse complaints that are sent to every e-mail address displayed. This will get the message to the right person,but it also causes more spam and abuse to people who are not responsible for solving these problems.\n\nTo solve this issue, an "abuse-c:" attribute is available in the organisation object. This optional attribute references a role object which is required to contain an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. Any Internet resource object (inetnum, inet6num, aut-num) that references this organisation object is then "covered" by this abuse email address.\n\nBy default, any query for an Internet resource object will return the related abuse email address. This appears in the query output as a comment line (starting with the % \'characters).\n\nThere is also a -b query flag to find the "abuse-mailbox:" attributes for any specific range. It returns the resource primary key with any abuse contact email address found. Also the prefix of any corresponding route or route6 objects, followed by the "abuse-mailbox:" attributes.\n\nIf no abuse contact is found in any encompassing objects then no object summaries will be returned.\n\nA complaint will not be handled any quicker by copying your message to any other e-mail address found in the database.\n\nThe -b query flag cannot be used with many other query flags.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Access Control for Queries\n\nThe control mechanism is based on the amount of contact information (contained in person and role objects) that is returned because of any queries made. Limits are based on the IP address of a whois client sending queries to the database server. Sometimes an IP address may be acting as a proxy and submitting queries on behalf of other IP addresses (for example, a webserver providing an interface to the RIPE Database). The database server provides a facility for such proxy clients that allows accounting to be based on the IP address of the clients using the proxy to query the RIPE Database and not on the IP address of the proxy server. This is done using the -V flag as follows:\n\n-V <version>,<ipv4-address>\n\n\nwhere\n\n * <version> is a client tag that usually represent the software version that the proxy uses\n * <ipv4-address> is the IPv4 address of the client that queries the database using the proxy\n\nNot all users can use this -V flag. You must contact RIPE Database Administration and tell us why you need this facility. If we approve your request, we will add the IP address of the proxy server to an access control list. You can then use the -V flag, but only from your stated IP address.\n\nAttempting to use the -V flag without approval may result in permanent denial of access to the RIPE Database. This denial of access will apply to the IP address that submits the query.\n\nWe restrict access to stop people using the RIPE Database to collect excessive amounts of contact data. If the amount of contact data returned by all your queries in a day (defined by UTC) exceeds defined limits, a temporary block on access is applied to that IP address. This block will be automatically released at midnight (UTC) to allow querying to continue. There is also a limit on the number of times an IP address can be blocked and recover. When this limit is reached, that IP address is permanently blocked from accessing the RIPE Database. This permanent block will not be automatically removed. The limits are defined in the RIPE Database Acceptable Use Policy\n\nThere are many reasons why you could find yourself in this position. One is that you are mining the RIPE Database for contact data to use for non-agreed purposes. In this case, the denial of access is justified and your IP address will remain on the blocked list. However, there may be other reasons. Queries for object types other than person and role objects return contact information by default. Using the -r or --no-referenced flag to prevent contact data being included in your query results can turn of this default. Alternatively, you may have an error in a script that runs automatically, retrieving contact data that you did not know about. If you believe there was a genuine error or mistake that led to the permanent block, you need to contact RIPE Database Administration. Explain the error and tell us what steps you have taken to stop it happening again. RIPE Database Administration will decide whether to remove the block. It will remain on record that this IP address has been permanently blocked and unblocked. If another permanent block occurs, we will be less likely to consider removing it a second time.\n\nEach time a person or role object is retrieved, a counter increases. When it reaches the limit defined in the AUP, the query execution is aborted and the connection is terminated, displaying an error message to the client (see "Access errors" in Appendix C,RIPE Database Query Server Response Codes and Messages). Also a count of denials increases. Retrieving any other object type does not affect these counters.\n\nAny role object used for abuse contacts with an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute is exception to this rule. No accounting is done on these objects.\n\nThere is also a limit on the number of simultaneous connections from a host. When this limit is reached, further connections from the same host are refused.\n\nIf we block your access, you will not be able to query for any object types. We will not just block your access to contact date alone.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Filtering the Query Response\n\nA filtering process restricts some data from the default query response. This applies to email contact data. When a user is searching for abuse contact data, they sometimes take all email addresses found in all objects in the query response. This may include the correct address. However, it often also includes many other addresses for people who are not responsible for handling such complaints.\n\nTo help overcome this issue, some attributes containing email addresses are filtered out of the default response. One exception to this is where a role object includes an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. The abuse email address is never filtered. If you include the -B or --no-filtering query flag then the response will not be filtered\n\nWhen any attribute has been filtered out of an object in the query response, a "Note:" is added to the response header to warn the user. In addition, the "source:" attribute of each filtered object in the response will have a comment added to the end of the line saying "# Filtered". If this filtered output is cut and pasted into an update message, including this end of line comment on the "source:" attribute, the update will be rejected for any filtered object. This is because some mandatory attributes may be missing and the "source:" will not be recognised. Filtered output can therefore not be accidentally used for updates.\n\nAny "auth:" attribute of mntner objects apart from those which reference to key-cert objects are always filtered when these objects are queried. This filtering cannot be turned off with any query flags. The only way to see an unfiltered mntner object is to authenticate using a password or SSO credential that matches an auth: attribute on the mntner.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Getting All the Members of Set Objects\n\nIn RPSL, an object can be a member of a set object in two ways.\n\n * You can list objects in a "members:" attribute in the set object.\n\n * You can use the "member-of:" attribute. You can use this in route, route6, aut-num and inet-rtr object types. The value of the "member-of:" attribute identifies a set object that this object wants to be a member of.\n\nHowever, just specifying "member-of:" is not enough. The referenced set object must also have a "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute. This lists the maintainer of the object that wants to be a member of the set. This means that the set owner must validate the membership claim of an object with a "member-of:" attribute. It does this by matching the "mnt-by" line of the object with one of the maintainers in the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes of the set object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Grouping the RIPE Database Output\n\nThere are two ways to order the objects in a query response.\n\nOne way is for the first part of the response to list the objects that are the direct results of the query. Then, the second part of the response lists all the secondary objects that are directly referenced from the objects in the first part of the response, like organisation and person. If any of these secondary objects are referenced by more than one of the returned objects, it will only be listed once in the response.\n\n$ whois  -i mb aardvark-mnt\n\nmntner:         AARDVARK-MNT\nadmin-c:        DW6465-RIPE\ntech-c:         DW-RIPE\nmnt-by:         AARDVARK-MNT\n\nkey-cert:       X509-1\nadmin-c:        DW6465-RIPE\ntech-c:         DW6465-RIPE\nmnt-by:         AARDVARK-MNT\norg:            ORG-EIP1-RIPE\n\norganisation:   ORG-EIP1-RIPE\nmnt-ref:        ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\ntech-c:         TCP-RIPE\nmnt-by:         RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nabuse-c:        AR13455-RIPE\n\nperson:         Denis Walker\nnic-hdl:        DW-RIPE\n\nperson:         Denis Walker\nnic-hdl:        DW6465-RIPE\n\n$ whois  -i mb aardvark-mnt\n\n% Information related to \'AARDVARK-MNT\'\n\nmntner:         AARDVARK-MNT\nadmin-c:        DW6465-RIPE\ntech-c:         DW-RIPE\n\nperson:         Denis Walker\nnic-hdl:        DW-RIPE\n\nperson:         Denis Walker\nnic-hdl:        DW6465-RIPE\n\n% Information related to \'X509-1\'\n\nkey-cert:       X509-1\nadmin-c:        DW6465-RIPE\ntech-c:         DW6465-RIPE\nmnt-by:         AARDVARK-MNT\norg:            ORG-EIP1-RIPE\n\norganisation:   ORG-EIP1-RIPE\nmnt-ref:        ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\ntech-c:         TCP-RIPE\nmnt-by:         RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nabuse-c:        AR13455-RIPE\n\nperson:         Denis Walker\nnic-hdl:        DW6465-RIPE\n\n\nThe default response is grouped. If you include the -G or --no-grouping query flag then the output will not be grouped.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Historical Queries\n\nThe RIPE Database holds a lot of historical data going back over ten years. This can be of use operationally and statistically. It is possible to query the history of operational data objects that still exist. The available historical data stretches back to the most recent time that the object was (re-)created. If an object is created, modified several times, deleted, recreated and modified again, the available data for this object will cover the most recent creation and modification, as well as the date that it was deleted. This policy of not showing historical data for deleted objects is subject to change.\n\nFor the available historical data, a list can be requested showing the versions with a timestamp. Each of these versions of the object can then be queried. Also, a diff is available between versions. These historical query flags do not have a short format and can only be used from the command line. These query flags are not available through either the web query form or the RESTful API.\n\nAll timestamps use the UTC timezone.\n\nAny attribute containing email addresses is filtered out from the query response. These may no longer be related to the object and, also, the owner of the email address may not want to receive any further communications concerning this data. It is also not possible to query for historical personal data objects i.e. person and role.\n\n“—list-versions”\n\nThe response to this is a list of available object versions with a timestamp. This timestamp is the date that an update was processed by the database server to create this version of the object. It is a system-generated timestamp; it is not information supplied by the user. The format looks like this:\n\n$ whois --list-versions 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% Version history for INETNUM object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255"\n% You can use "--show-version rev#" to get an exact version of the object.\n\n% This object was deleted on 2003-03-17 13:03\n\nrev#  Date              Op.\n\n1     2003-03-17 13:15  ADD/UPD\n2     2003-04-12 08:32  ADD/UPD\n3     2003-05-22 13:20  ADD/UPD\n4     2004-10-22 14:43  ADD/UPD\n5     2004-10-31 03:08  ADD/UPD\n6     2006-02-21 16:46  ADD/UPD\n7     2009-12-02 13:27  ADD/UPD\n8     2009-12-02 13:49  ADD/UPD\n9     2010-03-17 15:00  ADD/UPD\n10    2011-02-17 12:11  ADD/UPD\n11    2013-03-19 16:24  ADD/UPD\n\n\nThe specified primary key must be an exact match for an object. In the above example, you cannot request the history for 193.0.7.35. Even though this is part of the above range, these queries work on objects not hierarchies. Although this object existed prior to 2003-03-17, that part of the history is not available as it was deleted on this date.\n\n“—show-version #n”\n\nThis query will return one version of an object from the history list. Taking version #10 from the above example, the query response will look like this:\n\n$ whois --show-version 10 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% Version 10 of object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255"\n% This version was a UPDATE operation on 2011-02-17 12:11\n% You can use "--list-versions" to get a list of versions for an object.\n\ninetnum:        193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\nnetname:        RIPE-NCC\ndescr:          RIPE Network Coordination Centre\ndescr:          Amsterdam, Netherlands\nremarks:        Used for RIPE NCC infrastructure.\ncountry:        NL\nadmin-c:        JDR-RIPE\nadmin-c:        BRD-RIPE\ntech-c:         OPS4-RIPE\nstatus:         ASSIGNED PI\nsource:         RIPE # Filtered\nmnt-by:         RIPE-NCC-MNT\nmnt-lower:      RIPE-NCC-MNT\n\n\n“--diff-versions version-number:version-number”\n\nThis query will return the textual difference between two versions from the history list. Checking the difference between versions 10 and 11 in the example above will look like this:\n\n$ whois --diff-versions 10:11 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% Difference between version 10 and 11 of object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255"\n\n@@ -3,2 +3,3 @@\ndescr:          RIPE Network Coordination Centre\n+org:            ORG-RIEN1-RIPE\ndescr:          Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\n\nWe can see that a reference to an organisation object was added. If you reverse the version numbers, then the logical diff will show that the reference to an organisation object was removed when looking back over the timeline of changes, from more recent to older changes:\n\n$ whois --diff-versions 11:10 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% Difference between version 11 and 10 of object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n@@ -3,3 +3,2 @@\ndescr:          RIPE Network Coordination Centre\n-org:           ORG-RIEN1-RIPE\ndescr:          Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Inverse Queries\n\nInverse queries search for object\'s inverse keys that are supplied as an argument to a query. The query flag -i (or --inverse) must also be specified with appropriate query flag arguments. Inverse keys are defined in the templates of the RIPE Database objects. (See section \'RPSL Object Types\' for more details.) These templates can be listed by querying the RIPE Database. See section \'Accessing the Object Templates\' for more details. See Table 3: Query Flag Arguments to the “-” Query Flag and the Corresponding Inverse Keys\n\nBy performing an inverse query, the user requests all objects to be returned from the database that contain the specified query argument in the attribute(s) specified in the query flag arguments.\n\nIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS...                             ...THEN TYPE THIS IN THE QUERY INTERFACE:\nAll objects where contact person (or role) is XY-RIPE      -i person XY-RIPE\nAll objects that are protected by XY-MNT                   -i mnt-by XY-MNT\nAll objects that have XY-MNT as mnt-lower                  -i mnt-lower XY-MNT\nAll objects that have XY-MNT as mnt-routes                 -i mnt-routes XY-MNT\nAll objects that have ORG-XYZ-RIPE as their organisation   -i org ORG-XYZ-RIPE\nobject\nAll route/route6 objects that are originated by ASx        -i origin ASx\n\nExample:\n\nwhois -i admin-c <nic-handle>\n\nwill return all objects where the "admin-c:" attribute contains the <nic-handle> specified as the query argument.\n\nYou can specify several query flag arguments to request searches against several attributes in objects. If you want to do this, the query flag arguments should be entered as a comma-separated list with no white spaces. All the attributes searched must contain the same type of value. In other words, all the values must be maintainers or nic-handles or one of the other values listed in the appendix section on Supported Queries.\n\nExample:\n\nwhois --inverse mb,mnt-lower <mntner name>\n\nwill return all objects where the "mnt-by:" or the "mnt-lower:" attributes contain the <mntner name> specified as the query argument.\n\nExample:\n\nAn inverse query can be used to search for references to a person or role in objects. To find a person or role you could search for matching "admin-c", "tech-c", "abuse-c", "zone-c" attributes, however you need to specify all attributes separately. Instead you can specify "person" or "pn" to search all such attributes.\n\nwhois -i admin-c,tech-c,abuse-c,zone-c <person value>\n\nwill return the same results as\n\nwhois -i pn <person value> or whois -i person <person value>\n\nFinding the references for a person is very useful when someone leaves the company and you want to delete all the registers from this person. Note that you can also specify a role instead of a person:\n\nwhois -i pn <role value>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# IRR Toolset Support\n\nThe IRRToolset is a third-party suite of routing policy analysis tools. Some of the tools in this set access Routing Registry servers through an authorisation whois interface.\n\nThe RIPE Database server includes support for these query types. This section describes the additions to the RIPE Database user interface that allow it to support the IRRToolset. The required queries are:\n\n * Return the prefixes of all route and route6 objects with a specified origin – whois -Ki origin<asn>\n * Return only the primary keys of the route and route6 objects, not full objects – whois –KTroute,route6 <prefix>\n * Return the prefixes of all route and route6 objects referenced in a given route-set – whois –K <route-set>\n * Return all the members (aut-num or as-set object) of a specified as-set. This returns only the "members:" attributes, not the full object – whois –K <as-set>\n * Optionally, include support for expansion of the previous query, if the returned value contains references to as-sets, so that the result contains only a list of aut-num objects.\n\nThe RIPE Database server does not support this and it is up to the client to perform the expansion. The IRRToolset currently does the expansion.\n\n * Return route and route6 objects that exactly match a specified prefix - whois –BGxTroute,route6 193.0.0.0/21\n * Return route and route6 objects that exactly match a specified prefix (as above), but return only the "route:" or "route6:" attributes prefix - whois –KxTroute,route6 193.0.0.0/21\n\nSee Table 4: Query Support For Tools\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# More and Less Specific Lookups For Reverse Domains\n\nThe RIPE Database supports IP network queries including the -x, -M, -m, -L and -l functionality for reverse delegation domains. If you want to include reverse delegation domains in the query response when using the more or less specific or exact match query flags. You must also include the -d query flag, this will return all domain objects for the address range.\n\nPlease note that there is no hierarchy allowed with reverse domain objects. These queries work on the address space hierarchies and return the corresponding domain object, if found, for any address space objects in the query response.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Other Query Flags\n\n * The “-T” (“--select-types”) Query Flag\n * The “-K” (“--primary-keys”) Query Flag\n * The “-t” (“--template”) Query Flag\n * The “-v” (“--verbose”) Query Flag\n * The “-q” Query Flag\n * The “-a” (“--all-sources”) Query Flag\n * The “-s” (“--sources”) Query Flag\n * The “-S“ (“--resources" Query Flag)\n * The “-F” (“--brief”) Query Flag\n * The “--valid-syntax” and “--no-valid-syntax” Query Flags\n * The “-c” (“--irt”) Query Flag\n * The “-C” (“--no-irt”) Query Flag\n\n\n# The “-T” (“--select-types”) Query Flag\n\nThis query flag restricts the type of the objects returned to those specified. The query flag argument is a comma-separated list of object types. A space after "T" is optional but the list cannot contain any spaces.\n\n\n# The “-K” (“--primary-keys”) Query Flag\n\nThe -K (--primary-keys) query flag returns only the primary keys of each object in the query response.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this:\n\n * With set objects, the "members:" attributes will also be returned.\n * With route and route6 objects both the prefix and the "origin:" attribute are returned as these jointly provide the primary key.\n * No information is returned for person, role or organisation objects.\n\n\n# The “-t” (“--template”) Query Flag\n\nThe -t (--template) query flag returns a template of the specified object type as shown for each object in the section RPSL Object Types.\n\n\n# The “-v” (“--verbose”) Query Flag\n\nThe -v (--verbose) query flag returns a verbose description of the specified object type as shown for each object in the section RPSL Object Types.\n\n\n# The “-q” Query Flag\n\nThe RIPE Database server supports the retrieval of certain information about itself and the data sets served, using a -q query flag.\n\nThe -q query flag requests the server to reply with information about the system setup. It does not return any information extracted from any of the databases that it serves. This query flag takes a single argument, which has three possible values:\n\n * Version (usage: -q version). This will display version information for the server software\n * Types (usage: -q types). This will list all the object types recognised by the RIPE Database\n * Sources (usage: -q sources). This will list all available sources. That is, the local RIPE Database and all the mirrored databases\n\n\n# The “-a” (“--all-sources”) Query Flag\n\nThe -a (--all-sources) query flag requests that the server searches all the sources available to it and the response will include any output found from any of the available sources. These are the sources listed by using the –q sources query.\n\n\n# The “-s” (“--sources”) Query Flag\n\nThe -s (--sources) query flag requests that the server searches all the sources specified and the response will include any output found from any of these sources. The available sources are the sources listed by using the –q sources query. The argument to this flag can be a comma-separated list of sources. They will be queried in the order specified by the user. Search other mirrored databases, not only the RIPE Database.\n\n\n# The “-S” (“--resources) Query Flag\n\nThe -S (--resources) query flag search in other mirrored databases, such as: RIPE-GRS or ARIN-GRS, not only the RIPE Database. For example: whois -S ARIN-GRS 193.201.1.1\n\n\n# The “-F” (“--brief”) Query Flag\n\nThe “-F” (“--brief”) query flag changes the format of the returned objects. The attribute names are represented in a short hand notation. For example, "person:" becomes "*pn:". Using the –F query flag includes the non-recursive action of the –r query flag\n\n\n# The “--valid-syntax” and “--no-valid-syntax” Query Flags\n\nOver time, the syntax of database objects changes. The existing data is not always updated when these changes occur. Therefore, there are many objects in the RIPE Database with invalid syntax according to current rules. These query flags filter the objects in the query response. Either those objects with valid syntax, or those without valid syntax, will be returned in the response depending on the choice of flag.\n\n\n# The “-c” (“--irt”) Query Flag\n\nThe “-c” (“--irt”) query flag can only be used with queries for address space objects. The appropriate address space object for this query is returned in the query response. The query software then searches up the address space hierarchy (moving through the less specific objects) until an address space object is found that references an irt object, and then the referenced irt object is included in the query response. The default behaviour is not to return any referenced irt object.\n\n\n# The “-C” (“--no-irt”) Query Flag\n\nThe “-C” (“--no-irt”) query flag turns off the behaviour given with the “-c” query flag. Related irt objects are not returned by default.\n\n\n# The “-Z” (“--charset”) Query Flag\n\nThe "-Z" ("--charset") query flag specifies which character set the client expects. The default is latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Persistent Connections and Keeping State\n\nIf you are carrying out batched queries, your database client can request a persistent connection. The server will not close this connection after sending a reply to your client. This avoids having to set up a new TCP connection for every query.\n\nThe client can request this by sending the -k or --persistent-connection query flag to the server. This flag may be sent without a query argument to start the connection. Or it may be included as a query flag with the first query.\n\nDuring a persistent connection, the server operates a "stop-and-wait" protocol. This means that the next query cannot be sent until the reply has been received to the previous query. If you want to be able to send queries in batch mode, you must use a third-party tool, for example netcat or telnet, or the whois client with the file name ripe-whois-client-3.2.2.tar.gz that can be downloaded and compiled. The default whois client that is available with most operating systems may not allow this.\n\nTo exit a persistent connection, send the -k or --persistent-connection flag with no query argument or an empty query (\\n) to the server. The connection will also time out after a period of inactivity.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Queries for Autonomous Systems\n\nAS numbers can be either 32-bit or 16-bit. They are both described by a 32-bit number.From the point of view of the RIPE Database there is no difference. The difference is mainly historical.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Queries for IP Networks\n\nThe RIPE Database provides information about IP networks allocated or assigned within the RIPE NCC service region. This information is mainly stored as inetnum, inet6num, route and route6 objects. These objects store information about a single IP address or ranges of addresses.\n\nThe route and route6 objects use prefix notation to specify the single address or range of addresses about which they contain information.\n\n"Prefix notation" specifies ranges using two parts: the prefix and its length.\n\n * For IPv4, the prefix is a 32-bit integer written in dotted quad notation with the value of the lowest IP address in the range. The prefix length is a whole number in the range 0-32 (for example 193.0.0.0/22 specifies the range of 1024 IPv4 addresses starting with,and including, 193.0.0.0).\n * For IPv6 address ranges, the prefix length must be in the range 0-128 and is a 128-bit whole number, written in hexadecimal groups of two bytes separated by colons and with the possible use of shorthand notation for strings of consecutive 0s.\n\nThe inetnum objects represent an IPv4 address space in range notation. The inet6num objects represent IPv6 address space in standard prefix notation.\n\nWhen you query the RIPE Database for information about IP addresses, you can specify query arguments with the following notations:\n\n * A prefix (IPv4 or IPv6).\n * An explicit range (IPv4 only).\n * A single IP address. This is interpreted as a range of just one address. For IPv4, this can be written in range notation using the same start and end address. It could also be written as a single address. For IPv6, this has a prefix length of 128 or again it could also be written as a single address.\n\nFor IPv4 address space, the query argument can be specified with either prefix or range notation. When prefix notation is used, the database software converts this into range notation. An information message is included in the query response showing the conversions performed. For IPv6 address space, the query argument can only be specified in prefix notation. The single IP address is accepted as a short hand notation for a prefix. See Table 2: Queries For IP Networks table\n\nWe use three terms in these types of queries. These are all defined relative to the specified(reference) range:\n\n * An exact match refers to a range that is identical to the reference range.\n * A more specific range is contained within the reference range and is smaller. It contains fewer IP addresses than the reference range. We also call this a sub range.\n * A less specific range contains the whole of the reference range and is bigger. It has a greater number of IP addresses than the reference range. We also call this an encompassing range.\n\nThere are a number of options that describe how you can retrieve different types of information relative to a particular range of IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) including more and less specific queries.\n\n\n# Default Queries for IP Network\n\nIf you do not specify one of the following IP related query flags, and your query argument is a range of IP addresses in any one notation, a RIPE Database server will try to find an object with an exact match range for the specified range. If found, the exact match range is returned. If an exact match range cannot be found, the server looks for the object with the smallest less specific range. This will be the smallest, existing, encompassing range.\n\n\n# Exact Match Queries\n\nIf you want to change the default behaviour so that the server returns only an object with an exact match range, you need to use the –x (or --exact) query flag. This flag stops the server from looking for any less specific ranges if no exact match range exists. Not even the smallest encompassing range will be returned. If no exact match range is found, no object will be returned in the query response.\n\n\n# More Specific Range Queries\n\nThese refer to queries qualified by the use of the -M and -m query flags.\n\nThese queries will return information about objects with ranges of IP addresses that are fully contained within the reference range specified in the query argument. The returned objects contain fewer addresses than the specified range. More specific range queries do not return the exact match range if it exists.\n\n * -M (or --all-more) - requests that the server should return all the sub-ranges that are completely contained within the reference range. When there are hierarchies of sub-ranges, all levels of the hierarchies will be returned down to the smallest sub-range in each hierarchy. Many objects can be returned.\n * -m (or --one-more) - requests that the server should return all the sub-ranges that are completely contained within the reference range. When there are hierarchies of sub-ranges, only the top level of the hierarchies will be returned. These are usually called one level more specific ranges. Many objects can be returned.\n\n\n# Less Specific Range Queries\n\nThese refer to queries qualified by the use of the -L and -l query flags.\n\nThese queries will return information about objects with ranges of IP addresses that fully contain the reference range specified in the query argument. The returned objects contain a greater number of addresses than the specified range.\n\n * -L (or --all-less) - requests that the server returns the object with an exact match range, if it exists, and all objects with ranges that are bigger than the reference range and that fully contain, or encompass, it. Many objects can be returned.\n\n * -l (or --one-less) - requests that the server does not return the object with an exact match range, if it exists. It returns only the object with the smallest range that is bigger than the reference range and that fully contains, or encompasses, it. This is usually referred to as the one level less specific range. Only one object can be returned.\n\n\n# Less Specific Range Queries For Referenced IRT Objects\n\nAn irt object represents a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). It includes contact and security information. It is optionally referenced from inet(6)num objects using the "mnt-irt:" attribute (even though the irt object is not a mntner object). This shows which CSIRT is responsible for handling computer and network incidents for that address range.\n\nA reference to an irt object does not only apply to the inet(6)num object that contains the reference. It also applies to all inet(6)num objects that are more specific to the one containing the reference. Not every inet(6)num object needs to contain a reference to the irt object. The irt reference only needs to be placed in the least specific encompassing object to apply to a whole hierarchy of objects. This makes it easier to apply and maintain.\n\nThere may be more than one inet(6)num object in a hierarchy referencing an irt object. In this case, the one referenced from the smallest encompassing object is the one that applies to the range in question.\n\nThere is a -c (or --irt) query flag to make it easy to find the inet(6)num object containing the reference to an irt object for any specific range.\n\nThis flag makes the server search up the hierarchy of less specific range objects from the range specified as the query argument. The search will stop when the first object is found containing a reference to an irt object. This can be either the specified range or an encompassing inet(6)num object at any level in a hierarchy. The query will return the inet(6)num object found for the range specified in the query argument. The referenced irt object found in the hierarchy will also be returned.\n\nSometimes, no inet(6)num object is found in the hierarchy that contains a reference to an irt object. In this case, the query response will only contain the inet(6)num object found for the range specified in the query argument.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Queries Using Primary and Lookup Keys\n\nAll objects have a primary key. (See the section \'Attributes in an Object\' for more details) This is the most basic type of query that can be made in the RIPE Database. Based on the primary key, a very specific instance of an object type can be queried. In almost all cases, a query on a primary key will only return a single object (assuming the query has not selected to include directly referenced objects). In most of those situations, that object will have a primary key that exactly matches the query argument. For example, querying for ‘aardvark-mnt\' will only return the mntner object that has this as its primary key. In this example, you cannot query for a random part of the primary key. For example querying for ‘aardv\' will not return this object. However if you query for ‘aardvark\', you will not return this mntner object, but you will return any object containing the word ‘aardvark\' in a lookup attribute.\n\nIn some cases, with hierarchical primary key values, the returned object may not exactly match the query argument. For example, if you query for ‘193.0.7.35\' the returned inetnum object has the primary key value of ‘193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\'. Where address space is concerned, route(6) objects are usually returned with the address space object. So, in this case, you not only get objects with different primary keys, but also more than one object could be possibly returned in the query response.\n\nMany objects also have lookup keys. (See attribute section on \'Indexed\' for more details.) These are used for search type queries. If you query for ‘aardvark\', the response will include any object where the word ‘aardvark\' has been used in any attribute value of a lookup key, as well as any object where this is the primary key. For primary keys, the key would need to be an exact match with this word. A lookup key value only needs to include this word as part of the value. Individual words in lookup keys are separately indexed.\n\nThe terminology is a bit confusing. A query using a primary key is really a ‘lookup\' for a specific object exactly matching the query argument. A query using the lookup keys is really a ‘search\' for any objects containing the query argument.\n\nThere are several query flags that can filter or limit the objects contained in the response.\n\nExamples of all queries using primary and lookup keys are shown in the next table. See Table 1: Queries Using Primary and Lookup Keys\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Referenced Objects in Query Response\n\nA standard query will return a set of secondary objects that are directly referenced from the objects in the query response. For example, if the query response returns an inetnum object then, by default, the response will also include any directly referenced organisation, person and role objects. The person and role objects are subject to daily limits. A user can find themselves blocked for excessive querying of personal data objects even if they did not want that information.\n\nThis default behaviour can be turned off so that these secondary objects are not returned. There are two options for doing this:\n\n“-r” or “--no-referenced” With this query flag, none of the referenced secondary objects will be returned in the response. If an inetnum object references a role object as "admin-c:", a person object as "tech-c:", and an organisation object, none of these objects will be returned with the inetnum object.\n\n“--no-personal” This query flag only removes the personal objects, person and role. So, in the example above, the organisation object is still returned (Use this flag to avoid getting blocked for excessive querying of personal data).\n\n“--show-personal” This is the opposite of the --no-personal flag. Currently, it does not do anything but may be changed in the future.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# RIPE NCC Global Resource Service\n\nThe RIPE NCC mirrors several other databases, in near real-time, that are considered useful to anyone who queries the RIPE Database. These include the other Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). This allows queries to the RIPE Database to retrieve information from one or more of the mirrored databases. A local copy is maintained of each mirrored database. Daily updates are obtained from the mirrored databases to keep the local copies up-to-date.\n\nThe mirrored databases are referenced by the source of the data. A list of currently available sources can be obtained by using the “-q” query flag.\n\nAll mirrored databases are made available by the RIPE NCC in RPSL syntax with the same RPSL extensions as the RIPE Database. If the mirrored data stream has some other syntax, it is converted into RIPE Database syntax before submission to the local database copy. This means that the data returned to a user who queries a RIPE NCC mirror may not be in the same format as data returned by querying the original data source directly.\n\nUsers can query the RIPE NCC mirrored databases as if they were querying the RIPE Database by adding the “-s” query flag or “-a” query flag. Bulk access to any of the mirrored databases is not possible. The access control mechanism, described in the section on Access to Personal Data, applies to all data returned, regardless of the source.\n\nThe mirrors of the other RIRs\' databases only contain the resource information. They do not include all the personal data. To access the personal data users must query the other RIR databases directly.\n\nThe resource information received from the other RIRs in the daily data dumps is cross-referenced with the daily statistics published by each RIR. These statistics detail all the resources that each RIR is administratively responsible for. Only resources listed in these statistics are entered into the mirrored database. This eliminates any placeholder objects or aggregated blocks used administratively by the RIR. The result is a set of databases containing a global view of Internet resources administered by the RIRs.\n\nThis global database view can be queried collectively using the query flag —resource. This will return a single response from the RIR that claims to be administratively responsible for this resource.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Update Methods\n\nThe available options for updating the RIPE Database are:\n\n * RESTful API\n * Webupdates (web form)\n * Syncupdates\n * Email Updates\n\nHowever, these are not all distinct methods of updating the database. Some are front-ends to the others.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Email Updates\n\nEmail updates were the original method of updating the RIPE Database. They are still used by many people, although synchronous updates by the other methods now account for the majority of updates.\n\nEmail update messages must be in plain text and can be MIME-encoded. If encoded messages are multipart/signed, the signature part will be associated with the corresponding MIME text part. When an encoded message is received, the database software will take each valid MIME part (including any related signature part) and merge them into one update message. Please see section \'MIME Support\' for more information.\n\nPasswords needed for authorising the updates of all objects in the message must be included somewhere in the message. This is done with the pseudo-attribute "password:", for example:\n\npassword: some clear text\n\n\nThis "password:" pseudo-attribute can be placed anywhere in the message. One attribute is needed for each required password. If the message is MIME-encoded the passwords can be in any MIME part. When it is all merged into a single update message, all passwords found will apply to all objects in the update. Passwords can also be contained within the text part of a signed update message and apply to objects outside the signed part. All credentials will be extracted before any authorisation checks are made. The "password:" pseudo-attributes will be removed before any of the objects are processed. This ensures that they will never be considered as part of any object.\n\nAcknowledgements (ack) containing the result of the update are returned to the sender of the email based on the "Reply-to:" and "From:" fields in the email header. Notifications (notif) may also be sent based on email addresses found in the attributes within each object in the update message and the related mntner objects. See section on Notifications.\n\nTo submit an email update, send your email message to one of the following email addresses:\n\n * Email updates to the RIPE Database\n * Email updates to the TEST Database\n * Email updates to the RC Database\n\nThere is no limit on how many objects that can be included in an email update message, or MIME part. There is a maximum limit on the size of an email message, which is 40 MB.\n\nOnly one ack message is returned for each update message. However, there may be many notif messages generated for each object in the update. This can result in large numbers of emails sent out when an update contains many objects. The ack and all notifs are all sent out at the end of processing the whole update message. Your mail server needs to be able to handle large numbers of emails coming from a single source (@ripe.net), otherwise they may all get marked as spam. You should optimise the number of update messages and number of objects per update to suit your working practises.\n\n\n# MIME Support\n\nThe database software supports the MIME format. This means that you can cryptographically sign an update message using email agents that attach the signature in a separate MIME part, not in the body of the message. However, encryption of the text is not allowed. All update messages must be sent in plain text.\n\nNested signing of messages is possible, allowing an update message to be signed by one user, sent to another user who signs it again and submits the update.\n\nThe database software does not allow any scoping of authorisation within the message (for example, MIME parts where different passwords apply).\n\nIt is strongly recommended to keep MIME encapsulation simple. Complex MIME structures are more likely to generate errors.\n\nThe following rules apply when submitting updates using MIME encapsulation:\n\nThe software will recognise the following headers and take the appropriate actions:\n\n * multipart/signed\n * multipart/alternative\n * multipart/mixed\n * multipart/unknown\n * application/pgp-signature\n * application/x-pkcs7-signature\n * application/pkcs7-signature\n * text/plain\n\nAll other content-types are treated as text/plain.\n\nAfter extracting credentials and validating signatures, all MIME parts are merged together and treated as a single update message.\n\n\n# Subject Line Keywords\n\nThe subject line can have a special meaning in email update messages by using keywords. The available keywords, which are case-insensitive, are:\n\n * NEW\n * HELP\n * HOWTO\n\nOne way to use a keyword is to put the single keyword in the subject line of an email message, with NO other words. If any other word is found (for example, Subject: NEW objects) then none of the words will be treated as keywords. All words in the subject line will be reported in the acknowledgement reply as invalid keywords, along with a WARNING message. In this context, it is impossible to know if a word is meant as a keyword or just part of a comment.\n\nMany users often include their own references in the subject line. Using this method, it is not possible to also use a keyword. The user\'s references are reported in the WARNING message as invalid keywords.\n\nSome examples: Subject: new\n\nThis is an accepted keyword. Subject: sending my new objects\n\nNone of these words are accepted as a keyword and all reported in the warning message.\n\nUse the NEW keyword if you want the database to only accept new objects. In this case, all objects found in the update are assumed to be creation operations. If an object already exists in the database, that object will result in an error message in the acknowledgement. However, the remaining objects will still be processed.\n\nThe HELP keyword causes a piece of text to be returned in the acknowledgement that contains information about how to query and update the database. When this keyword is used the body of the update message, it is ignored. HOWTO performs the same action as the HELP keyword.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# RIPE Database RESTful API\n\nFor more information about the REST paradigm, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer. All the services are accessible via HTTPS. Use of the Whois REST API is governed by the RIPE Database terms and conditions\n\n\n# RESTful URI format\n\nEach object in the RIPE Database has a unique locator URI, in the following format:\n\nhttps://rest.db.ripe.net/{source}/{objecttype}/{key}\n\nWhere:\n\n * Source is the database source (e.g. RIPE).\n * Objecttype is the object type (e.g. inetnum)\n * key is the primary key(s)\n   * Normally key is a single attribute value.\n   * Use the nic-hdl attribute value for person or role object types.\n   * Combine the route(6) attribute value and origin attribute value for route or route6 object types (e.g. route 193.0.22.0/23AS3333).\n\n\n# Environments\n\nENVIRONMENT   PROTOCOL   CLIENT CERT   ENDPOINT\nTEST          HTTP       No            http://rest-test.db.ripe.net\nTEST          HTTPS      No            https://rest-test.db.ripe.net\nTEST          HTTPS      Yes           https://rest-cert-test.db.ripe.net\nRIPE          HTTP       No            http://rest.db.ripe.net\nRIPE          HTTPS      No            https://rest.db.ripe.net\nRIPE          HTTPS      Yes           https://rest-cert.db.ripe.net\n\n\n# POST\n\nCreate an object in the RIPE database.\n\nHTTPS is mandatory.\n\n# METHOD: POST\n\n# URI Format: /{source}/{objectType}\n\n# Path Parameters\n\nNAME         DESCRIPTION\nsource       RIPE or TEST (depending on location)\nobjectType   object type.\n\n# Query Parameters\n\nNAME          DESCRIPTION\npassword      Password for maintainer authentication (one or more values).\nunformatted   Keep the formatting of the resource as provided in the\n              request (spaces, end-of-lines) .\ndry-run       Optional.

The Authorisation request header\n                value contains \'Basic\' followed by the base64 encoding of\n                the maintainer name and password separated by a colon.\n\n# HTTP Request Body\n\nA WhoisResource containing the object to be created.\n\nThe client should specify the desired response format using the Accept: header in the HTTP request. If unspecified, the response defaults to XML.\n\nThe HTTP request must include a Content-Type: header for POST, PUT and DELETE. The HTTP response will include a Content-Type: header, and the response body will be encoded in the requested format.\n\nThe possible values that you can specify for the Accept/Content-Type header are:\n\n * application/xml for XML\n * application/json for JSON\n\nClients can also append an extension of .xml or .json to the request URL instead of setting an Accept: header.

A question mark character (\'?\' or 0x3F) is used as a substitution character, if the character is outside the latin-1 character set.\n * The response should contain a warning, if conversion was necessary. known issue #291\n * Unrecognised encodings that cannot be converted to latin-1 will result in an unsuccessful operation.\n * To be absolutely certain of what was stored in the database, do a follow-up query.\n * The REST API response will be in UTF-8.\n * We recommend to use UTF-8 character encoding in all REST API requests, but restrict the content to valid latin-1 characters.\n\n\n# Update latency\n\nIt could take up to 10 seconds before an update becomes visible for lookup or search operations. For non-hierarchical object types (person, role, organisation,...), the typical latency is less than 1 second. For hierarchical objects types (inet(6)num, route(6), domain), it is about 3-5 seconds on average, up to 10 seconds maximum.\n\nA way to work around this limitation is to rely on the response of the muting operation in REST API (PUT, POST, DELETE). These all return the object as it appears in the database in their response body after the successful update. This object is never filtered or altered in any way.\n\nAny required passwords must also be supplied as part of the Uniform Resource identifier (URI) using the URI query parameter "password=". One parameter should be used for each password supplied. The pseudo attribute "password:" cannot be used in the HTTP request body. See "Email Updates" for more information.\n\n\n# Client Certificate Authentication\n\nClient Certificate Authentication is supported by our REST API. To use the client certificate service, you must have your own certificate: either from a certificate authority (CA) such as Let\'s Encrypt, or you can generate one yourself.\n\nThe key-cert object\'s client certificate status is validated by checking its notBefore and notAfter dates to ensure it is within its designated validity period. This involves comparing the current date against these dates: if the certificate is not yet valid (notBefore) or has expired (notAfter), it is considered invalid and an error is raised. This validation ensures that the certificate is only used within its valid time frame, maintaining secure and reliable authentication.\n\nAdditionally, signed updates are only considered valid for an hour after they are signed. After that the authentication will fail.\n\n\n# Examples\n\n * Create your own certificate:\n   * Generate the private key: openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048\n   * Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR): openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr\n   * Generate the self-signed certificate using the CSR: openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -signkey client.key -out client.crt\n * Example using curl and previous certificate:\n   * curl --cert client.crt --key client.key -X PUT --data @form.txt\'https://rest-cert.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/TP1-RIPE?dry-run&password=...\'\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Syncupdates\n\nSyncupdates enables updates to the RIPE Database synchronously, meaning, the result is returned immediately to the user. It is intended for use by applications that need to update the RIPE Database and are able to process the result afterwards. An interface can easily be created in any language that supports the HTTP protocol. Syncupdates supports HTTP GET and POST methods (both multipart and URL-encoded formats). It can also be used directly via a web form.\n\nSyncupdates accepts the following parameters (query params for GET, form params for POST):\n\n * DATA\n   This variable should contain the actual update message.\n * NEW\n   This variable can be either yes or no. If it contains yes, the update will fail if it contains changes to existing objects.\n * HELP\n   This variable can be either yes or no. If it contains yes, the help message of the whois server will be given as the output.\n\nMultiple objects are accepted in the body, and any required passwords must also be supplied in the body using the "password:" attribute.\n\nAfter composing the input and sending it as a POST or a GET request, the server will return the usual http response headers and the body if an acknowledgement exists.\n\nThe first line of the response will give the result of the transaction, in the form of:\n\nHTTP/1.1 (code) (message)\n\nwhere (code) is a three-digit number which is a code for the message. The first digit of the code denotes the type of the message. The rest of the digits are unique for all messages:\n\n * 2XX denotes a successful transaction\n * 4XX denotes that the request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax,\n\nIf the code begins with 2, there will be an acknowledgement in the body of the response, in the form of text/plain.\n\nThese are the actual codes returned by Syncupdates:\n\n * 200 OK (successful)\n * 400 Bad Request (invalid HTTP request, URL or parameters)\n\nSyncupdates can be accessed using the following URLs:\n\n * Syncupdates for the RIPE Database\n * Syncupdates for the TEST Database\n * Syncupdates for the RC Database\n * Syncupdates via the web form\n\nExamples of GET requests:\n\ncurl -4 -v -d "HELP=yes" https://syncupdates-test.db.ripe.net\n\ncurl -4 -v https://syncupdates-test.db.ripe.net/?HELP=yes\n\n\nExample of a POST request:\n\ncurl -v -4 -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------466af99a9520" --data-binary @form.txt https://syncupdates-test.db.ripe.net\n\n----------------------------466af99a9520\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="DATA"\n\norganisation:   ORG-TS1-TEST\norg-name:       RIPE NCC Training Services\norg-type:       LIR\naddress:        Singel 258, 1016 AB Amsterdam\nphone:          +31205354444\nfax-no:         +31205354444\ne-mail:         training@example.org\nadmin-c:        TS1-TEST\ntech-c:         TS1-TEST\nabuse-c:        AA2-TEST\nref-nfy:        auto@example.net\nnotify:         xnotify@example.org\nmnt-ref:        TEST-DBM-MNT\nmnt-by:         TEST-DBM-MNT\nsource:         TEST\npassword:       some clear text \n----------------------------466af99a9520--\n\n\nThe aim of this service is to provide updates around the clock, except for maintenance operations. In cases where it\'s not possible to update the database, Syncupdates will return with the following message:\n\n"Updates are unavailable at the moment. Please try again later."\n\nBehind Syncupdates, the software has a separate handler to the one used for both the RESTful API and Webupdates. This handler is the same for both scripted access to Syncupdates or the web form access. This handler will accept multiple objects in the same update. This allows for a different type of usage to the RESTful API. A single response is returned to the user with the results of processing all the objects in the update message. The same timing issue applies across the whole update as referred to in the Webupdates description above. If an update has a very long list of objects and the http connection times out during the update, the processing of the update will still run to completion. No response message will be returned to the user after an http timeout. Notification emails will always be sent on completion.\n\nTo modify data without affecting the underlying database, you can use dry-run\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Webupdates\n\nWebupdates can be accessed via the following URLs:\n\n * RIPE Database\n * TEST Database\n * RC Database\n\nWebupdates is a graphical front-end for the RESTful API. It allows objects to be created, modified and deleted from either the RIPE or TEST Database and their RC equivalents. Object templates are available to guide users through object creation and modification. These can be selected as individual fields or a single text area. In field mode, a template for creating a new object will only show the mandatory attributes. Additional and optional attributes can be added to the template as required. In text area mode, the initial template will show all possible attributes for an object type. The mandatory attributes are in upper case and the optional ones are in lower case. It is not possible to switch between the field mode and text area.\n\nWhen the submit key is clicked, the data is sent via the RESTful API to the database software. This restricts input to single object processing only. If you paste more than one object into a text area, an error will occur.\n\nWhen deleting objects, the full object is presented to you for verification and you must then enter the reason for the deletion.\n\nWhen an object is queried using the Webquery form, ‘hover over\' buttons are available to take any object from the query results directly into Webupdates to update or delete the object.\n\nObjects up to a maximum size of 10MB can be managed through the Webupdates interface. If any errors occur during the update, the error messages are shown either:\n\n * In a single error block at the start of the form- if they are general errors\n * Within the form- if the error is specific to a particular attribute and you are using the field mode\n * In a series of error blocks at the start of the form- for errors specific to particular attributes but you are using the text area mode\n\nThere is no maximum amount of time for an update operation to be completed. You should set your timeout to the highest possible value. Problems sometimes occur with reverse domain objects. Because of all the DNS checks made, reverse domain objects sometimes take longer to process, and your connection may occasionally time out. The update will still be completed by the database server, but no acknowledgement will be returned if the connection has timed out. Notification messages are always sent by email, and will be sent regardless of your connection status.\n\nAny required passwords must also be supplied. These can be entered via the form password field. When using the text area input mode, passwords can also be included the message body using the "password:" attribute. More information about passwords is available in \'Email Updates\'\n\n\n# Creating Basic RIPE Database Objects\n\nYou need to create a number of objects in the RIPE Database in order to fill in the RIPE Database Template.\n\nPlease follow the steps below in order to create them.\n\n 1. RIPE NCC Access Account You need to have a RIPE NCC Access account in order to be able to use the web interface of the RIPE Database.\n    \n    You can create your RIPE NCC Access account using https://access.ripe.net/registration\n\n 2. Role Object and Maintainer Object Each role objects describe a business function. Each object has a unique NIC handle as primary key.\n    \n    Maintainer objects protect object in the RIPE Database. They contain the information needed to authorise creation, deletion or modification of the objects they protect.\n    \n    You can create your first role and maintainer objects using the object creation tool.\n    \n    Choose a name for your maintainer object and enter it in the "mntner" field which will be the primary key.\n    \n    \n    \n    When you receive the message "Your objects have been successfully created", make a note of your role object\'s primary key and mntner object\'s primary key.\n    \n    You can use your role object\'s primary key (NIC handle) in the "admin-c:", "tech-c:" and "zone-c:" fields of the RIPE Database Template.\n    \n    You can use yor mntner object\'s primary key in the "mnt-by:" field of the RIPE Database Template.\n    \n    You can create additional person, role and mntner objects and also change the objects you already created using RIPE Database Webupdates.\n\n 3. Organisation Object Organisation objects contain information about organisations. Each object has a unique organisation ID ("organisation").\n    \n    You can create organisation object using RIPE Database Webupdates\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Keep "AUTO-1" in the "organisation" field. The organisation ID will be created automatically. Enter the primary key of your mntner object in the "mnt-ref" field. Use the "bell" icon to fill in the "abuse-c" field.\n    \n    \n    \n    When you receive this message: "Your object has been successfully created". For example, "organisation ORG-XYZ-RIPE", make a note of the new organisation ID (ORG-XYZ-RIPE).\n    \n    You can use the organisation ID in the "org:" field.\n    \n    Please note that organisation objects with IANA, RIR, NIR or LIR can only be created by the RIPE NCC. Any other entity must use OTHER in the "org-type:" when creation organisation objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Accessing the Object Templates\n\nTo create or modify an object you may need to access the template for that object. These are shown along with a detailed description of each attribute and its value in section 4. RPSL Object Types.\n\nFrom almost any computer, if you have a terminal window with a command line prompt, you can use either netcat (nc) or telnet commands to obtain any of the object templates. For this purpose, they both do the same job, but netcat is considered to have better error handling than telnet.\n\nFor example, getting the template for an inetnum object using these methods:\n\nUsing netcat in a terminal window to obtain an object template:\n\n$ nc whois.ripe.net 43\n% This is the RIPE Database query service.\n% The objects are in RPSL format.\n%\n% The RIPE Database is subject to Terms and Conditions.\n% See http://www.ripe.net/db/support/db-terms-conditions.pdf\n\n-t inetnum\ninetnum:        [mandatory]  [single]     [primary/lookup key]\nnetname:        [mandatory]  [single]     [lookup key]\ndescr:          [mandatory]  [multiple]   [ ]\ncountry:        [mandatory]  [multiple]   [ ]\ngeofeed:        [optional]   [single]     [ ]\ngeoloc:         [optional]   [single]     [ ]\nlanguage:       [optional]   [multiple]   [ ]\norg:            [optional]   [single]     [inverse key]\nsponsoring-org: [optional]   [single]     [inverse key]\nadmin-c:        [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key]\ntech-c:         [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key]\nabuse-c:        [optional]   [single]     [inverse key]\nstatus:         [mandatory]  [single]     [ ]\nremarks:        [optional]   [multiple]   [ ]\nnotify:         [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-by:         [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-lower:      [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-domains:    [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-routes:     [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-irt:        [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\ncreated:        [generated]  [single]     [ ]\nlast-modified:  [generated]  [single]     [ ]\nsource:         [mandatory]  [single]     [ ] \n\n% This query was served by the RIPE Database Query Service version 1.92.5 (ANGUS)\n\n$\n\n\nUsing telnet in a terminal window to obtain an object template:\n\n$ telnet whois.ripe.net 43\nTrying 2001:67c:2e8:22::c100:687...\nConnected to whois.ripe.net.\nEscape character is \'^]\'.\n% This is the RIPE Database query service.\n% The objects are in RPSL format.\n%\n% The RIPE Database is subject to Terms and Conditions.\n% See http://www.ripe.net/db/support/db-terms-conditions.pdf\n\n-t inetnum\ninetnum:        [mandatory]  [single]     [primary/lookup key] \nnetname:        [mandatory]  [single]     [lookup key]\ndescr:          [mandatory]  [multiple]   [ ]\ncountry:        [mandatory]  [multiple]   [ ]\ngeofeed:        [optional]   [single]     [ ]\ngeoloc:         [optional]   [single]     [ ]\nlanguage:       [optional]   [multiple]   [ ]\norg:            [optional]   [single]     [inverse key]\nsponsoring-org: [optional]   [single]     [ ]\nadmin-c:        [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key]\ntech-c:         [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key]\nabuse-c:        [optional]   [single]     [inverse key]\nstatus:         [mandatory]  [single]     [ ]\nremarks:        [optional]   [multiple]   [ ]\nnotify:         [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-by:         [mandatory]  [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-lower:      [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-domains:    [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-routes:     [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\nmnt-irt:        [optional]   [multiple]   [inverse key]\ncreated:        [generated]  [single]     [ ]\nlast-modified:  [generated]  [single]     [ ]\nsource:         [mandatory]  [single]     [ ]\n\n% This query was served by the RIPE Database Query Service version 1.92.5 (ANGUS)\n\n\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n$\n\n\nTo obtain the template with the full description of each attribute and its value, use -v instead of -t in the above commands. Once you have the template, it can be copied into an email message or pasted into a web form or added into a script to generate objects. To create an object from the template, you must remove all the attribute lines that you do not want. For the remaining lines, you must replace the description with the value. Where an attribute is multiple, further lines can be added with additional values.\n\nWith some update methods the template is provided for you - for example, when using Webupdates. If you select to create a new object using field mode it presents a set of fields matching all the mandatory attributes for the selected object type. Optional attributes can be selected from a drop-down menu. More instances of any given attribute can be inserted. If you choose the text area mode, a list of all attributes is presented in the text area. The mandatory attributes are in upper case and the optional attributes are in lower case. Delete the optional ones you don\'t want to use. The software later converts all attribute names to lower case.\n\nThe Webupdates text area template can be used to present a template to be cut and pasted in another form or medium. The Webupdates object creation process does not present the full template information. It only shows lists of attributes. To get the full template details, as shown in section 4. RPSL Object Types, use the Web Query form (by selecting the Query option from Webupdates) and enter the following query for the appropriate object type as the ‘Search term\':\n\n-t inetnum\n\n\nUsing -v instead of -t in the Web Query form will present the longer output describing all the attributes.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Dry-run\n\nThe TEST Database has always been promoted as the place to "try" an update to see what happens. But the TEST Database has very little data. It is also reset every 24 hours. So if you want to test anything that has dependencies on other data, you have to reproduce it all in the TEST Database to do the test. That in itself can be a major effort. And tomorrow it is all gone.\n\nTo address this, there is a "dry-run" feature that lets you test updates on the production RIPE Database. All your data is there with the correct authorisation tokens. All dependencies are taken care of. You can submit your update and see what the result would be, but nothing is actually changed in the database.\n\nTo use the dry-run feature, submit an update by any available update method.\n\nEnter whatever you want for this single object. Use the correct syntax or include deliberate errors, full set of credentials or not - it all depends on what you want to test. Somewhere in the update, enter the "dry-run:" pseudo-attribute on a new line:\n\ndry-run:\n\n\nIt does not need a value. If you add any text it will be ignored. This pseudo-attribute can be added anywhere in the update message in the same way as the "password:" pseudo attribute can be. Then submit the update.\n\nThe update is received by the RIPE Database production software. All the checks are done on the object:\n\n * Syntax\n * Business rules\n * Authorisation\n * Referential integrity\n\nThen it stops! Nothing is changed in the RIPE Database.\n\nAn acknowledgement message is returned to the user who submitted the update by the normal channels, depending on the input method used. No notifications are sent. So only the user who is testing the update gets the results. For a dry-run update that would modify an object, the diff output that would normally be in the notification message is added to the dry-run acknowledgement message. This helps to show what would be changed by an actual update. See the section on Notifications for more details.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Format of the Update Message\n\nHistorically updates were only sent to the database using email messages. Currently, there are many other methods of submitting update information to the database. However, we still refer to an update as an update message.\n\nThe different ways of submitting the update message are described in section Email updates. The method that is used passes the data to an appropriate handler in the software. These handlers extract the one or more database objects from the update message along with any credentials, including passwords, PGP signatures and single sign-on session details. An object must start with one of the recognised object type attributes. These are described in section RPSL Object Types. The object ends with the first blank line found after the type attribute. This is technically defined as two consecutive new-line characters ("\\n\\n"). An object cannot contain a blank line. If a blank line is required for the visual representation of an object it must be either a "remarks:" attribute with no ‘value\' part or, if it is a continuation line of any attribute, it must start with a plus sign ("+"). See section Split Values for more details.\n\nWe apply a heuristic method to each paragraph of text in the update message to determine if it is an RPSL object. Any part of the message that is not recognised as an RPSL object is ignored. These ignored parts are grouped together at the end of the acknowledgement message.\n\nThe object(s) presented in the update message must each match one of the object templates described in section RPSL Object Types. These templates can be accessed in several ways. See section Accessing the Object Templates.\n\nEach instance of an object must contain at least one of each of the mandatory attributes for that object type. The optional attributes can be left out, unless the software business rules require them. If any of the optional attributes are included they must have a ‘value\' part, unless the value is defined as free text. Free text values can be blank. Depending on the update method, one update message may contain several objects, with a mixture of creation, modification and deletion operations.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Garbage Collection\n\nWhen specific objects of a certain type have existed in the database unreferenced for a continuous period of time, it becomes eligible for automatic deletion.\n\nThe object types include person, role, mntner, organisation (not if the type is LIR) and key-cert. Clusters of these objects that form a self-referencing group, without any reference from resource data, will also be deleted.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Historical Data\n\nEvery time an object is updated in the RIPE Database, the old version is saved. A standard query will always return the most recent version. The old versions are available by using the history query flags. See the section on Querying Historical Data for more details. Personal historical data is not available.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Object Processing\n\nWhen an update message contains multiple objects, the order of processing the objects in the message only changes in specific situations. The database software tries to process the objects one by one, starting with the first recognised object in the message. The order can matter, however, the database software has limited options for changing the order. The only condition the software can recognise is when an auto-generation process is used for certain object primary keys. "AUTO-n" primary key values can be included for generation and can also be referenced by other objects in the same update message. These will be resolved, as long as the number "n" is consistent and there are no circular references. If an object that references a value ‘AUTO-1\' is listed in the update message before the object where the value ‘AUTO-1\' is generated, the ordering will be changed. The referencing object will be pushed to the end of the list, by which time the object crating the ‘AUTO-1\' value will have been processed.\n\nThe below figure shows an example of two objects that will be created but in a different order. The second figure shows an example of two objects that will not be created as there is a circular reference between the ‘AUTO-n\' attributes that can never be resolved. (Only the relevant parts of the objects are shown in the figures.)\n\ninetnum:     193.0.7.35\nadmin-c:     auto-1\n\n\nperson:      admin guy\nnic-hdl:     auto-1\n\n\nIn the example of the figure above. the second, person object must be created first. This gives a real value to ‘auto-1\'. Then the first, inetnum object can be created referencing that real value for ‘auto-1\'.\n\norganisation:    auto-1\nadmin-c:         auto-2\n\n\nperson:          admin guy\nnic-hdl:         auto-2\norg:             auto-1\n\n\nIn this figure, the object can be created because of the circular reference to ‘auto-n\' values. They both need to create a real value for an ‘auto-n\' tag. But they both reference the ‘auto-n\' tag of the other object, which does not yet exist.\n\nYou can avoid these complex arrangements of, and circular references to, auto-generated values in a single update message by sending multiple, consecutive updates instead.\n\nWhen processing each individual object, the software makes many checks including that:\n\n * The syntax of the object is correct.\n * The object passes all required authorisation checks.\n * All references to other objects can be resolved without conflicts.\n * The operation does not compromise referential integrity. For example, when an object is to be deleted, the server checks that it is not referenced from any other object in the RIPE Database.\n * The object complies with all software business rules, for example, not creating an allocation resource object without including the optional "org:" attribute. This is required in an allocation object.\n * The object complies with relevant policies, such as having the correct "status:" value in inetnum objects.\n\nIf all checks are passed, the update will be successful for this object. If one of these checks fails, the operation fails for this object. This is shown in the acknowledgement message and sometimes in notification messages. See the section on Notifications for more details.\n\nEach object in the update message is processed independently of others (except for the ‘AUTO-n\' references). If the operation fails on one object, the following objects will still be processed. There may, however, be consequences of a previous failed operation. For example if a person object creation fails, a later object creation which references this person object will fail the referential integrity checks because the person object does not exist in the database.\n\nAfter the software finishes processing all the objects in the update message, an acknowledgement message is returned to the sender of the original update. For email update messages, the acknowledgement will be another email sent to the address as specified in the "Reply-to:" field or "From:" field. For synchronous update messages it will be returned via the open HTTP connection. If the connection has timed out or been closed, no acknowledgement is sent. In all cases, the update will still be completed by the database software regardless of the status of HTTP sessions of validity of email addresses. Notification messages may also be sent. See the section on Notifications for more information about this.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Special Considerations for Object Creation\n\nMost object types follow the same rules when created. Some object types have additional business rules that only apply to those types when they are created.\n\n\n# Creating PERSON and ROLE Objects\n\nTo create person and role objects, you can either choose your own unique NIC handle or you can use ‘AUTO-n\' where the server will automatically assign a NIC handle.\n\nTo request the server to assign a NIC handle for you, specify the value of the "nic-hdl:" attribute as:\n\nnic-hdl: AUTO-<number>[<initials>]\n\nThe number is required. It does not form part of the NIC handle but acts as an index. If your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this NIC handle by the index. See the sub-section Object Processing for examples. The initials are optional. If you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the NIC handle. Otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "person:" or "role:" attribute. The syntax definition of a NIC handle allows for an optional suffix at the end of the character string. The default suffix is "-RIPE" when an ‘AUTO-n\' NIC handle is used. If you want to use another suffix, or have no suffix, or you want to select the number part, then you must specify the full NIC handle and not use the ‘AUTO-n\' option. Please note that if you specify a NIC handle that is currently in use, it may be considered as a modification operation, which may cause the operation to be refused depending on the update method used. See section 6.4 Update Operations for more details. If the operation continues, as a modification, it will usually result in an authentication error. If you select a NIC handle that has previously been used and deleted, an error will be returned.\n\nIf you are creating your first person or role object in the database, you must follow the procedure described in the sub-section \'New Organisation Startup\'.\n\n\n# Reusing NIC Handles\n\nThe person and role objects are identified by NIC handles. Historically, these were available to reuse as soon as an object was deleted. Many NIC handles have been used and reused by several different people. As that can lead to confusion, the NIC handles are no longer reusable. When a person or role object is created, the NIC handle is added to a list of used NIC handles. When the object is deleted the NIC handle remains on the list. It can never be reused. Please note that these objects cannot be deleted if they are referenced by any other object. This avoids accidental deletion of an object that is still in use. While some people try to create NIC handles with a ‘"meaningful\'" name, it should be remembered that they are only meant as a database index. If you delete one that is unreferenced, then realise you still need it, you will need to create a new one.\n\n\n# Creating ORGANISATION Objects\n\nTo create an organisation object, you must specify the ID of the object as ‘AUTO-n\'. It is not possible to select the ID yourself. It is always auto-generated.\n\norganisation: AUTO-<number>[<initials>].\n\nThe number is required. It does not form part of the ID but acts as an index. If your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this ID by the index. See the sub-section \'Object Processing\' for examples. The initials are optional. If you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the ID. Otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "org-name:" attribute.\n\nFor example, if you want ‘TTR\' as the initials in the organisation ID, you should put ‘AUTO-1TTR\' into the "organisation:" attribute, when you create the object. If you delete an organisation object you cannot recreate one with the same ID as the one you deleted or with any other ID that has been used previously.\n\n\n# New Organisation Startup (Creating First Objects)\n\nWhen you first use the RIPE Database, you need to create some basic objects. Every object you create in the database must be maintained. That means you need a mntner object. This object must reference a role (or person) object as a contact. However, the role (or person) object must be maintained. Therefore, a user cannot create either of these two objects first using any of the usual update methods.\n\nThere is separate page to create a role and maintainer pair, so that new users can get started.\n\nIf errors occur during the creation process, these are reported back to the user. If successful, the mntner object name and the NIC handle are returned to the user. There is no partial success allowed. If one object can be successfully created during the intermediate stage, but the second object has errors, no object will be created.\n\nIf you have nothing in the RIPE Database, this startup script is the only way to get started. Once you have this first pair of objects, you can use the normal update methods for all other objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Update Operations\n\nThere are three update operations that can be performed on an object:\n\n * create\n * modify\n * delete\n\nThe create and modify share a lot in common. Initially, when an object is presented by either email or Syncupdates, the database software has to decide if the object already exists or not. If it exists, the operation is modify. If it does not exist the operation is create. This issue can be forced with the use of the keyword ‘NEW\'. If this keyword is included then the operation is set as create. If the object already exists, it will be an error. An existing object will never be updated when this keyword is included in the update. For email updates, this keyword will be in the ‘Subject\' line. For client-based Syncupdates this keyword is passed as a parameter. It is not possible to use the keyword with the web-based Syncupdates form at: https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates\n\nThe RESTful update method works differently as it follows the standard REST paradigm. If the data is received by a POST method, the ‘NEW\' keyword is set and it can only be a create operation. If the data is received by a PUT method it can only be a modify operation. If the method and operation do not match it is an error.\n\nWebupdates uses the RESTful API as the update method. So it must also follow the REST paradigm. There are additional checks at the Webupdates form level to ensure the right method is used.\n\nIf the operation is modify and the supplied object data is identical to the existing object stored in the database, allowing for white space variations, then the object is not modified. This is considered to be a successful ‘NO OPERATION\'.\n\nThe delete operation is the same no matter what update method is used. The full version of the object must be supplied exactly as it is stored in the database. The supplied version is checked against the stored version by compressing the white spaces and doing a string comparison. If they don\'t match, the delete operation fails. If you query for the object before supplying the query result in a delete operation, make sure you use the correct query flags to avoid any filtering of the returned object. See section on Filtering Query Output for more details.\n\nTo delete an object, there must be no references to it from any other object in the database. A single reference will prevent it from being deleted. Note, however, that not all attributes containing primary keys of other objects are hard references. The routing policy attributes in an aut-num object can list other AS Numbers but these are not considered as references for the delete operation.\n\nFor the RESTful API and also Webupdates, the delete method is used. For mail and Syncupdates the pseudo attribute "delete: some reason text" must be added to the object data. As these update methods allow multiple objects in an update message, this pseudo-attribute must be part of the object itself to ensure a strong association with this pseudo-attribute and a specific object. Each object that is to be deleted must have a "delete:" pseudo attribute attached to it. It can be added at any point within the object or immediately before or after the object.\n\nObjects can still be deleted from the database even if they are not syntactically correct. This allows for old objects to be deleted long after the syntax has been changed. If the object was to be modified, any syntax errors would need to be corrected.\n\nFollowing Acceptable use policy, we strive to detect potential attacks. If a DoS attack is detected, we temporarily block the user\'s IP address.\n\nThe RIPE Database Terms and Conditions allow the RIPE NCC to block or suspend access to the RIPE Database services for any suspected abuse. Users exhibiting suspected abusive behavior may be permanently blocked from the system. If a user is permanently blocked, they will receive a notification informing them of the block whenever they attempt to make an update.\n\nIf you wish to be unblocked, please contact the RIPE Database administration team ripe-dbm@ripe.net to discuss further.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# History of the RIPE Database\n\n * Background of the RIPE Database\n * Versions of the RIPE Database\n\n\n# Background of the RIPE Database\n\nFrom the very first RIPE Meeting in 1989, the need for some sort of registry had been identified. In the early years of RIPE, this consisted of documenting the use of IPv4 address space in the RIPE region on a voluntary basis. The actual address space was not distributed by RIPE.\n\nFrom August 1992, the newly established RIPE NCC started distributing address space in its service region. Allocations made by the RIPE NCC have always been documented in the registry by the RIPE NCC and the Local Internet Registries (LIRs). The RIPE NCC address registry was set up to serve two purposes:\n\n 1. A comprehensive public record of the address space for which the RIPE NCC has administrative responsibility. This concerns both address space allocated by the RIPE NCC and address space allocated by others and transferred to the administrative responsibility of the RIPE NCC.\n 2. A comprehensive public recording of the current holders of the address space. With the exhaustion of IPv4 address space, there will be no more unallocated IPv4 address space. However, the need for an accurate registry will remain.\n\nTransparency and accountability about the administration of Internet number resources has always been very important. Publication of the registry is an essential element of this transparency and accountability. The registry plays an important part in the operational coordination between Internet operators. The Internet Routing Registry (IRR) was established in 1995. Its purpose is to ensure stability and consistency of the Internet-wide routing by sharing information between network operators.\n\nOriginally, the RIPE Database was used by many Domain Name Registries as their ccTLD authoritative registry database. For some of the larger ccTLD registries, the RIPE Database was not their authoritative database but held a lot of duplicated information from the Domain Registries. In some cases, it just held a top-level forward domain object and used a "refer:" attribute to re-direct any queries to their authoritative whois service. Because this was a mixed up and incomplete system, it was decided at RIPE 57 in October 2008 to remove all forward domain information from the RIPE Database. This was completed in January 2011.\n\n\n# Versions of the RIPE Database\n\nThe original first version of the RIPE Database no longer exists and we have no information about it.\n\nThe second version of the RIPE Database was written in PERL and used files to store the data rather than a database. The data was in the ripe-181 format. This version provided a clear separation of routing information from allocation details.\n\nVersion 3 was released in April 2001. In this version, the old RIPE Database ripe-181 format was converted to the new RPSL format. The software was written in C and the data was stored in a MySQL database.\n\nThe basic design of the data model is still the same now. Since its release several years ago, many additional features have been added. New object types were added in 2004, including the organisation object. When the RIPE NCC started to encourage the adoption of IPv6, theRIPE Database software was made fully compliant with IPv6 and additional object types were added for this: inet6num and route6.\n\nWeb forms were introduced for both queries and updates shortly after this version was released. These have been constantly revised over the years and are still subject to regular minor improvements and occasional major improvement.\n\nA RESTful API was introduced, which was deployed to production in 2013.\n\nThe software underwent a major re-factor, still in C, in 2004. It was totally rewritten in Java in 2012, for queries, and early 2013- for updates. The database backend was switched from MySQL to MariaDB in 2016.\n\nThis database software is also used, with some local modifications, by APNIC and AFRINIC.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Personal Data, Database Management and Responsibilities\n\n * Personal Data in the RIPE Database\n * Database Management\n * Responsibilities of the RIPE NCC and Data Maintainers\n\n\n# Personal Data in the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE NCC provides the software and the hardware infrastructure to operate the RIPE Database service. The RIPE NCC also provides 24/7 monitoring and engineering support to maximise reliability, availability and performance. There is a customer support service to provide assistance to those using the RIPE Database.\n\nMost personal data is not registered in the RIPE Database by the RIPE NCC but by others (generally, those responsible for the specific Internet number resources or by the data subjects themselves). The RIPE NCC has only limited, control (and in some cases, no control) over the personal data stored in the RIPE Database. The purpose and means of processing personal data registered in the RIPE Database are not determined by the RIPE NCC but by the RIPE community. However, the RIPE NCC is the organisation that implements and/or oversees the implementation of instructions given by the RIPE community. In that sense, the RIPE NCC could be seen as the responsible party for processing personal data in the RIPE Database in accordance with the Dutch Data Protection Act.\n\nSteps are taken to prevent bulk access to personal data and limits exist on how many personal data objects can be queried in a 24-hour period. In some situations, the data made available in some forms is dummified. This is a process by which information that could identify a person or organisation is removed from the output.\n\nAnyone whose personal details have been entered into the public RIPE Database should have been informed by the person/organisation that entered those details. If you find your personal details within the RIPE Database and you had no knowledge of this, you should, firstly, raise this issue with the person/organisation that entered those details. You may find it is a condition of a contract that provides your Internet services, but you had not realised it.\n\nIf you want these details corrected or completely removed from the RIPE Database you should again, in the first instance, contact that same person/organisation that maintains this data in the RIPE Database. If they do not comply with your request to your satisfaction, the RIPE NCC has a procedure for the removal of personal contact details from the RIPE Database. You must realise that the consequences of removing such data may result in the cancellation of some services. That is a matter you must take up with the service provider.\n\nFor more information regarding Personal Data in the RIPE Database, please refer to the RIPE NCC Data Protection Report where more information can be found about the processing of personal data and the applicable legal framework.\n\n\n# Database Management\n\nThe RIPE NCC is tasked by the RIPE community to manage the RIPE Database as a public service. Although the RIPE NCC has limited control over the personal data registered in the RIPE Database and is not responsible for all of the operational data content, there are occasions when the RIPE NCC may correct or delete RIPE Database data:\n\n * According to accepted RIPE Policy Proposals/RIPE Documents\n * To comply with applicable law\n * If so ordered by any competent court\n * To fulfil any legal obligation\n * When a breach of the Terms and Conditions has occurred\n * For management operations of the RIPE Database\n * If data is inaccurate\n * If data has been entered by someone who is not authorised to do so\n * If an individual has requested the removal of their personal data\n\nThis list may change over time and is not exhaustive. For further details please refer to the Terms and Conditions.\n\n\n# Responsibilities of the RIPE NCC and Data Maintainers\n\nIn terms of managing the RIPE Database public service, there are some things the RIPE NCC is and is not responsible for.\n\n * The RIPE NCC does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness or availability of the RIPE Database or of the data contained therein.\n * The Maintainer is responsible for keeping all data maintained by them accurate and up-to-date, including correct contact details. The data must be good enough to allow the RIPE NCC to contact the Maintainer or Registrant within a reasonable time without having to get information from another source.\n * The Maintainer who enters personal data into the RIPE Database has a responsibility to inform the individual to whom the data pertains and to obtain his/her explicit consent for the entry in the public RIPE Database if required by law.\n * The RIPE NCC is not responsible for the use of any registered Internet number resources nor is the RIPE NCC responsible for any issues that may arise from this use.\n * The RIPE NCC is not responsible for any issues arising from the use of any information contained within the public RIPE Database.\n\nThis list may change over time and is not exhaustive. For further details please refer to the Terms and Conditions.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# Purpose and Content of the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE NCC has been tasked by the RIPE community to maintain a database of Internet resource information. Some of this information is confidential between the RIPE NCC and the resource holder and some of it is publicly available. The RIPE Network Management Database, more often referred to as the RIPE Database, provides the public view of this data. Some of the management details for maintaining Internet resources in this database are also confidential, for example MD5 password hashes. The RIPE Database provides access to this private data for resource holders.\n\nThe RIPE Database holds data for three separate registries:\n\n * RIPE Internet Number Registry (RIPE INR)\n * RIPE Internet Routing Registry (RIPE IRR)\n * Reverse Delegation and ENUM Registry\n\nThese could be three independent databases, however the information in each of them is related to each other. It was therefore decided to integrate the three registries into one logical database. In practise, it is also one physical database.\n\n\n# Purpose of the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE Database contains information for the following purposes:\n\n * Ensuring the uniqueness of Internet number resource usage through registration of information related to the resources and their Registrants and Maintainers (RIPE INR)\n * To provide accurate registration information of these resources in order to meet a variety of operational requirements\n * Publishing routing policies by network operators (RIPE IRR)\n * Facilitating coordination between network operators (network problem resolution, outage notification etc.)\n * Provisioning of Reverse Domain Name System (DNS) and ENUM delegations\n * Scientific research into network operations and topology\n * Providing information to parties involved in disputes over Internet number resource registrations to parties who are legally authorised to receive such information.\n\n\n# RIPE Internet Number Registry\n\nGlobal Internet resources are allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). The RIPE Internet Number Registry (RIPE INR) contains details of the Internet resources managed by the RIPE NCC within the RIPE NCC service region. These details in the RIPE Database are maintained jointly by the RIPE NCC and the Registrants of those resources. The RIPE INR also contains details of sub-allocations and assignments made from these resources by the Registrants. This information is maintained in the RIPE Database by the Registrants of those resources.\n\nThe information includes the organisations that hold the resources, where the allocations were made, and contact details for the networks. Dates of when changes were made to this information are also included, and some of the historical information is also available.\n\n\n# The RIPE Internet Routing Registry\n\nThe RIPE Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is part of a global distribution of databases by which network operators can publish their routing policies and their routing announcements so that other network operators can make use of the data. In addition to making Internet topology visible, the IRR is used by network operators to look up peering agreements, determine optimal policies, and more recently, to configure their routers.\n\nEach RIR has its own IRR. There are also many independent IRRs, for example RADb. A resource holder can register their routing information in any of the IRR databases. Most of the larger IRRs mirror each others\' routing information. Therefore, it is only necessary to enter this information into one IRR.\n\nOnly resources allocated to the RIPE region can be registered in the RIPE IRR.\n\nThe benefits of the IRR are only realised when registered routing policies are kept up-to-date, and reflect routing announcements in the \'real world\'.\n\n\n# Reverse Delegation\n\n\n# What is Reverse Delegation?\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is a globally distributed Internet service. It provides name-to-number (forward) and number-to-name (reverse) translations, using defined client-server and server-server protocols. The DNS is a public service - any Internet user is freely able to query the DNS system for forward or reverse translations.\n\nReverse DNS delegations allow applications to map to a domain name from an IP address. Reverse delegation is achieved by use of the special domain names in-addr.arpa (IPv4) and ip6.arpa (IPv6).\n\nFor all IP address blocks that IANA allocates to the RIPE NCC, they also delegate the corresponding reverse DNS zones within the centrally administered \'in-addr.arpa\' and \'ip6.arpa\' zones.\n\nThe RIPE NCC also publishes \'zone fragments\'. These are the parts of zones managed by other parties - the other Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), who share zone management of early registration networks.\n\n\n# Reverse Delegation in the RIPE Database\n\nThe RIPE Database is used as the management database to produce the DNS zones RIPE Internet Number Resources. It can provide the information for each delegated IPv4 and IPv6 range registered in the reverse DNS.\n\nThe information is stored in routing policy specification (RPSL) format as domain objects. The name of each domain object is the reverse DNS zone under in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa or e164.arpa. The "nserver:" attributes in each domain object define the officially delegated DNS name servers- the “NS” in DNS zone contents.\n\n\n# Domain Names\n\nThe RIPE Database used to contain information about domain names for Top Level Domain Registries based in the RIPE NCC service region as well as a few other regions. These were all removed from the RIPE Database by the end of 2011. The RIPE Database now contains no information about forward domain names. Further information about domain names can be found on the IANA ccTLD web page.\n\n\n# Administration of Internet Resources\n\nIANA is responsible for ensuring the uniqueness of the full set of Internet resources. This includes the full range of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and the whole 32-bit Autonomous System (AS) Number range. IANA allocates blocks of these resources to each of the five RIRs for them to distribute to their members and end users.\n\nThe RIPE Database contains large placeholder allocation objects to represent the range of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that have been allocated by IANA to the RIPE NCC. Not all of this address space has been allocated yet by the RIPE NCC to LIRs or end users.\n\nThe RIPE Database also holds details of legacy Internet resources. "Legacy" is the term given to those Internet number resources that were distributed before (or outside of) the current system of hierarchical distribution by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Legacy Internet resources were transferred to the RIPE NCC from the IANA\'s central registry according to the location of their legal organisation contact at the time.\n\nLegacy address space represented in the RIPE Database is structured into an administrative hierarchy. For every legacy hierarchy in the RIPE Database there is one inetnum that sits at the top of the hierarchy. The RIPE NCC considers the holder of this inetnum as the top-level legacy resource holder. All more specifics to this object are considered to have some business or contractual or historical relationship with the top-level legacy resource holder.\n\nIt is intended that the RIPE Database must only hold information about IP addresses that the RIPE NCC is administratively responsible for. There may still be some historical data that needs cleaning up.\n\nThe full range of 32-bit AS Numbers are represented in the RIPE Database by the as-block objects. All ASNs assigned by the RIPE NCC are represented in the RIPE Database by aut-num objects.\n\nIt should be noted that the RIPE Database is part of the global Internet Routing Registry. It may contain route(6) objects relating to any address space. This does not indicate any authoritative or administrative control over these Internet resources by the RIPE NCC.\n\nThere is a link between the number registry and the routing registry in order to authorise the creation of these route(6) objects. As a result, the originating ASN must be represented in the RIPE Database. Because of this requirement, many aut-num objects have been created in the RIPE Database that are copies of ASNs that the RIPE NCC is not administratively responsible for. This can sometimes cause confusion when the copied aut-num object in the RIPE Database reflects different contact details or routing policy to the object held in the database of the authoritative RIR.\n\n\n# Mirrored Databases\n\nThe RIPE Global Resource Service (GRS) provides resource information mirrored from several other databases. These are held in physically separate databases but logically part of the RIPE Database service. They can be queried using several of the RIPE Database interfaces. The information is updated daily from the authoritative source.\n\nThe following databases are mirrored:\n\n * AFRINIC\n * APNIC\n * ARIN\n * JPIRR\n * LACNIC\n * RADb\n * (RIPE GRS)\n\nTo view the up-to-date list of mirrored databases, perform the following query:\n\nwhois.ripe.net -q sources\n\n\nBecause the RIPE NCC is bound by Dutch and European data privacy laws, we are obligated to remove all personal data received from other databases. This is either removed at the source or stripped out and deleted during the transformation process. THe RIPE NCC does not store any personal data from other registries. Where necessary, we create and reference dummy objects to keep data integrity intact.\n\nBefore importing the data we transform objects into RIPE RPSL syntax by carrying out the following steps:\n\n * Adding missing mandatory attributes\n * Wrapping unrecognised attributes with "remarks"\n * Creating dummy objects for missing data to keep referential integrity\n * Converting attributes values\n * All these transformations are marked by "End Of Line" comments in the objects\n\nTo use GRS from the web interface, select the appropriate radio button below the search box. When using telnet or the whois command line client, add the --resource flag to your query to query only the dummified GRS databases, or the -a flag to query all available databases, i.e. GRS sources and the original RIPE Database combined.\n\n\n\nUsing the API, you can specify one or multiple GRS source names as parameters, e.g. "source=arin-grs" or "source=arin-grs&source=apnic-grs". For more information, please refer to the documentation on Github.\n\n\n# Criteria for a Mirrored Database\n\nDatabases mirrored by the RIPE NCC must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nThe mirrored database must be:\n\n * Public\n * Large\n * Useful to users in the RIPE NCC service region\n\nThe RIPE NCC reserves the final judgement on mirroring a database. You can request the RIPE NCC to mirror a database by contacting us.\n\n\n# I Want to Change Something in the RIPE Database\n\nChanges can be proposed to the RIPE Database purpose and content by anyone from the RIPE community using the RIPE Policy Development Process.\n\n\n# Terms and Conditions\n\nThe legal statement of what the RIPE Database is, and how it can be used is defined in the RIPE Database Terms and Conditions. While the information in the RIPE Database is made freely available to the public, it is all subject to these terms and conditions.\n\n----------------------------------------',normalizedContent:'#

documentation.\n\nthe documentation is divided into sections that are featured in the sidebar to the left. you can switch between these sections and items at any time by clicking on the links.\n\nyou can also use the searchbar above to search for any word or phrase on any page.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# appendix k- api keys\n\napi keys are a way to authenticate updates in the ripe database. they are associated with a user’s ripe ncc access account, and are intended to help users script (automate) updates to the ripe database.\n\n\n# introduction\n\napi keys are a way to authenticate updates in the ripe database. they are associated with a user’s ripe ncc access account, and are intended to help you script (automate) updates to the ripe database. if you only make updates using the web interface, then you don’t need api keys!\n\nto start using api keys, go to the web query page, login to ripe ncc access, and go to the api keys page on the left-hand menu. https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/api-keys\n\n\n# create a new database key\n\non the api keys page, click on “create a new database key”.\n\n * enter a key name (required) : a short description of how the key will be used.\n * enter an expiration date (required) : when does the api key stop working. keys are time-limited for security reasons and are valid up to a year in the future.\n * enter a maintainer (optional) : if you have added your ripe ncc access account to more than one maintainer, you can restrict the api key to only work with one specified maintainer.\n\nthen click on "create a key".\n\nwhen the key is created you\'ll see a popup.\n\nthe api key is composed of two parts. you can either use it combined in a single http authorization header, or separately as a username and password using your http client.\n\nmake sure to copy down either the combined header value or the username and password. the password will only be shown to you once. the username will be used subsequently as the key id.\n\n\n# list database keys\n\nafter closing the popup, the new key appears in a list, including:\n\n * name (the text you entered describing the key)\n * key id (the generated username part of the key)\n * last used (the last time the key was used to successfully authenticate an update)\n * expiration date (the date on which the key expires and can no longer be used)\n * details (any other attributes such as the maintainer if entered)\n\n\n# authenticated queries using an api key\n\nto authenticate using an api key, you must first associate your ripe ncc access account with a maintainer using an auth: sso attribute. then you can authenticate queries and updates as your ripe ncc account using the newly created api key.\n\nyou need to authenticate a database query if you want to update a maintainer, so you can read the entire object including auth: attributes unfiltered. the entire mntner object is returned, including all auth: attributes and no "filtered" comment.\n\nfor example:\n\n$ curl -v --header "accept: application/xml" \\\n --header "authorization: basic nkhevorlsffetvbhvue5vfpjqjvsrfvcolc2r2ffddjta1ry\nrk84eggyrxfgvtrqaа==" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/mntner/shryane-mnt?unfiltered\n\n\n\n# authenticated updates using an api key\n\nwe will now update a person object that is used as a "tech-c:" attribute by the maintainer.\n\nfirst query for the unfiltered person object. you don’t need to authenticate this step.\n\n$ curl -o output https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/es7554-ripe?unfiltered\n\n\nthen edit the "output" file and make a change to the person object.\n\nthen make the update in the database.\n\nfor example:\n\n$ curl -v \\\n  --header "authorization: basic nkhevorlsffetvbhvue5vfpjqjvsrfvcolc2r2ffddjta1ry\nrk84eggyrxfgvtrqaа==" \\\n -x put -d @output \\\n --header "content-type: application/xml" \\\n https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/es7554-ripe\n\n\nthe person object is updated successfully if the response is 200 ok.\n\n\n# revoking an api key\n\nif you suspect that an api key has been compromised - e.g. if anyone else could know what it is - then it’s safest to revoke the key and create a new one.\n\nto do this, find the api key on the page and click on the “revoke” button.\n\nas soon as you revoke a key it cannot be used to authenticate queries or updates in the ripe database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# access to personal data\n\nfor privacy and data protection reasons, there is a limit to how much personal data a user can query from the ripe database over a period of time. for more details of the legal background, see the ripe ncc data protection report.\n\npersonal information is contained in the person object. there may also be some personal information in some role objects. the access control mechanism built into the database software therefore applies to both person and role objects.\n\nthe access control mechanism used is based on the number of these objects that are returned in the results of any queries made. limits are applied to the ip address of a user sending queries to the database server by any of the query methods. (see \'how to query the ripe database\' for more details of the methods.)\n\nsometimes an ip address may be acting as a proxy and submitting queries on behalf of other ip addresses (for example, a webserver providing an interface to the ripe database). the database software provides a facility for proxy operators, which allows accounting to be based on the ip address of the end users using the proxy to query the ripe database, and not on the ip address of the proxy operator. this is done using the -v flag as follows:\n\n-v &lt;version&gt;,&lt;ip-address&gt;\n\n\n * <version> is a client tag that can be any text string chosen by the proxy operator. operators often use a string, showing the version of the software that the proxy operator uses, or, sometimes, they use an identifying string for the proxy operator.\n * <ip-address> is the ipv4 or ipv6 address of the end user that queries the database using the proxy service\n\nnot all users can operate a proxy service and use this -v flag. you must contact ripe database administration\n[ripe-dbm _at_ ripe _dot_ net] and explain why you need this facility. if your request is approved, the ip address of the proxy server will be added to an access control list. the proxy operator can then use the -v flag, but only from the ip address stated in the request.\nattempting to use the -v flag without approval, or from any ip address not on the access control list, may result in permanent denial of access to the ripe database. this denial of access will apply to the ip address that submits the query using the -v flag.\n\n\n# blocking access to the ripe database\n\neach time a person or role object is returned as part of a query result, a counter increases. when it reaches the limit defined in the aup, the query execution is aborted and the connection is terminated, displaying an error message to the client (see the section on access errors in the ripe database query server response codes and messages). there is also a separate counter, tracking the number of times your request is denied. retrieving any other object type does not affect these counters.\n\nany role object used for abuse contacts with an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute is an exception to this rule. no accounting is done on these objects.\n\nwe restrict access to the ripe database to stop people from using it to collect excessive amounts of contact data. if the number of personal contact objects returned by all your queries in a day (defined by utc) from one ip address exceeds the limits defined in the acceptable use policy (aup), that ip address\'s access will be blocked. if your access is blocked, you will unable to query the ripe database for any object types - you are not just blocked from accessing contact data objects. this temporary block will be automatically released at midnight (utc) to allow querying to continue. there is also a limit on the number of times an ip address can be blocked and recover. when this limit is reached, that ip address is permanently blocked from accessing the ripe database. this permanent block will not be removed automatically.\n\nthere are many reasons why you could find yourself blocked from querying the ripe database. one is that you are mining the ripe database for contact data to use for non-agreed purposes. in this case, the denial of access is justified and your ip address will remain on the blocked list. however, there may be other reasons why your ip address has been blocked. queries for object types other than person and role objects return contact information by default. using the -r or --no-referenced query flag to prevent contact data being included in your query results turns off this default. alternatively, you may have an error in a script that runs automatically, retrieving contact data that you did not know about.\n\nif you believe there was a genuine error or mistake that led to a permanent block, you should contact the ripe database administrators, explaining the error and what steps you have taken to stop it happening again. the ripe database administrators will decide if the block will be removed. it will remain on record that this ip address has been permanently blocked and then unblocked. if another permanent block occurs, it is less likely to be removed again.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# appendix

following object types references the person object to be removed and:\n\n * this is the only person or role object referenced in the object.\n * there are no options available for changing the reference.\n\n\nforward domain\nthis is a top-level domain (tld) problem. if the tld is not responsive, the tld should remove its data from the ripe database.\n\nreverse domain\nthese objects should be deleted and removed from the dns system.\n\ninet(6)num\nthe address space must be returned to the appropriate internet registry and then the object can be deleted.\n\nthe ripe ncc will take no action until the data subject has cancelled any routing arrangements for the address space to be returned and any related route(6) objects have been deleted.\n\naut-num\nthese objects should be deleted.\n\nthe ripe ncc will take no action until the data subject has cancelled any routing arrangements where this as number is the origin and any related route(6) objects have been deleted.\n\nrole\nif the role object only references this one person object, find all the references to the role object and consider them as if they were direct references to the person object.\n\nmntner\nfind all objects that reference this mntner object and carry out the following actions on each of these objects:\n\n * where there are references to more than one mntner object in the same attribute type, remove the reference to this mntner object.\n * if it is referenced in an optional attribute, remove the attribute.\n * where an object references only this mntner object in a single instance of a mandatory attribute, consider this object as if it had a single reference to the person object to be deleted. this object may also need to be deleted and then follow the chain of references to this object and handle all referencing objects according to this list.\n\nwhen all references to the mntner object have been removed, delete the mntner object.\n\nkey-cert\nreferences to person objects are optional, so remove any reference to this person object from the key-cert object.\n\nirt\nremove references to this irt object from inet(6)num objects, then delete the irt object.\n\norganisation\nreferences to person objects are optional, so remove any reference to this person object from the organisation object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# appendix g- object types with personal data\n\npersonal contact details are only held in these object types:\n\n * person\n * role\n * organisation\n * irt\n\nrole object references can be replaced by one or more of the person objects it references.\n\norganisation object references are optional everywhere except in inetnum objects with a status of allocated. references to organisation objects can simply be removed from anywhere else.\n\nirt object references are all optional. these references can also simply be removed.\n\nin all cases, the role, organisation and irt object can then be deleted when there are no references to it.\n\nperson objects are discussed in detail in this procedure.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# appendix h- pgp authentication method\n\nin this

of how to use client certificate authentication to make a whois update via the rest api.\n\none advantage of this method is that no secret is shared with the whois server during the request. however, one drawback is that getting started is more complicated than other authentication methods.\n\n\n# generate a self-signed certificate\n\nfirst generate a self-signed x509 certificate using openssl, along with a private key, in a single step.\n\n$ openssl req -x509 -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha384 -subj "/c=nl/cn=ripe.net" -keyout client-key.pem -nodes -out client-cert.pem\n\n\na signed x509 certificate from a certificate authority can also be used, but whois does not verify the trust path to the ca, only the signature against the certificate.\n\n\n# convert certificate to ascii\n\nnext display the certificate as ascii, which is a base64 encoded version of the binary (pem) certificate file, which is necessary to create a key-cert object.\n\n$ openssl x509 -in client-cert.pem\n-----begin

database\n\n\n# introduction\n\nthe ripe ncc has a test database where users may learn how to use the software. this database uses the same software as the ripe database, but is completely separate. you cannot change anything in the ripe database by changing an object in the test database.\n\nthe data in the test database is not a copy of the data in the ripe database. also, it is not authoritative data. no value should be put on the data in the test database. the database is reset to a default state each night.\n\nyou can create objects in the test database to simulate a part of your real network. you can then experiment with different situations in this test environment safely.\n\n\n# creating objects in the test database\n\nthere are different ways to create objects in the test database\n\n                \nweb interface   for creating a single object using a form. go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/#/webupdates/select\n                to get started, create a role and maintainer pair. go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/create/test/role/self\nmailupdates     email you object to test-dbm@ripe.net. you will receive an\n                acknowledgement message with the result.\nsyncupdates     for creating one or more objects at a time, using a single\n                field to edit objects. go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates you can\n                also submit updates from the command line (or script) via:\n                https://syncupdates-test.db.ripe.net/\nrest api        software api to create a single object at a time. documented\n                in whois rest api. the base url for the test environment is\n                https://rest-test.db.ripe.net/test\n\n\n# finding objects in the test database\n\nthere are different ways to find objects in the test database\n\n                \nweb interface   go to

pb3-ripe\n                the query flags that work in the ripe database also work in\n                the test database. we invite you to try them.\nrest api        software api to search whois or lookup a single object.\n                documented in whois rest api\n\n\n# mntner objects in the test database\n\nyou can create your own mntner objects in the test database. this mntner object only maintains objects in the test database.\n\nthese are different ways to create a mntner object in the test database.\n\n                \nweb interface   to create a single object (choose mntner from the dropdown):\n                (a) go to\n                https://apps-test.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/webupdates/select\n                (b) choose mntner from the dropdown and click create\n                (c) complete the form and click submit\nrest api        software api to create, update or delete a single object.\n                documented in whois rest api\nmailupdates     (a) complete (fill in) a mntner object template\n                (b) email the completed template to test-dbm@ripe.net.\n                (c) you will receive an email reply with the result.\n\nthere are some ripe ncc maintainers in the test database which can be used for authentication.\n\n                  \ntest-dbm-mnt      maintainer for test dbm objects. the maintainer password is\n                  "emptypassword" without the quotes.\ntest-ncc-hm-mnt   hostmaster maintainer. the maintainer password is\n                  "emptypassword" without the quotes.\n\n\n# creating inetnum allocations in the test database\n\nfor this example, use the web interface to create an inetnum.\n\nif you did not create your own mntner object, please use test-ncc-hm-mnt as the mntner of the inetnum.\n\nafter typing in the inetnum field value, you will be prompted to choose a mntner to authenticate the update operation. choose test-dbm-mnt and deselect the checkmark that says "also authorise my ripe ncc access account for this maintainer".\n\nfor example, create an inetnum with a /21 prefix in the 2/8 range.\n\nthe “org:” (organisation) attribute is required for an inetnum object with the status ‘allocated pa’ or ‘allocated pi’. the mntner password for the organisation "mnt-ref:" attribute must be known in order to make a reference to the organisation. the organisation object must have an "org-type:" attribute with the value ‘lir’ for the \'allocated pa\' status (for example, use org-eipb1-test as an lir and authenticate with the test-dbm-mnt password).\n\n\n# creating aut-num objects in the test database\n\naut-num objects in the ripe database are only assigned by the ripe ncc. however, you are free to create aut-num objects in the test database.\n\nyou can create an aut-num object from create an object page.\n\nyou can also create an aut-num object using the syncupdates.\n\nyou need to authenticate with the test-dbm-mnt password, which maintains the root as-block object.\n\n\n# creating route objects\n\nfor this example, use the web interface to create a pair role and maintainer.\n\nyou need to create an lir organisation as well. normally lir organisations are created by the ripe ncc for a member. only an lir organisation can be referenced from an allocation. use your newly created role (e.g tr1-test) as the admin-c and tech-c. use your newly created mntner (e.g. testmnt-mnt) as the mnt-by.\n\nyou can also create the organisation using the syncupdates. e.g.:\n\norganisation:    auto-1\norg-name:        test organisation\norg-type:        lir\naddress:        amsterdam\ne-mail:         eshryane@ripe.net\nadmin-c:         tr1-test\ntech-c:          tr1-test\nmnt-ref:         testmnt-mnt\nmnt-by:          test-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:          testmnt-mnt\nsource:          test\npassword: emptypassword\n\n\nafter creating the organisation you need to create an allocation. normally the allocations are created by the ripe ncc for a member organisation. you need some address space before creating a route object. use your new organisation (e.g. org-to2-test) as your "org:" reference\n\nyou can also create the allocation using the syncupdates. e.g.:\n\ninetnum:         11.0.0.0 - 11.0.0.255\nnetname:         nl-test\ncountry:         nl\norg:               org-to2-test\nadmin-c:         tr1-test\ntech-c:          tr1-test\nstatus:          allocated pa\nmnt-by:     test-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:          testmnt-mnt\nsource:          test\npassword: emptypassword\n\n\nfinally, you can create the route object in the address space that you have just allocated.\n\nyou can also create the route object using the syncupdates. e.g.:\n\nroute:           11.0.0.0/24\norigin:          as3333\ndescr:           route\nmnt-by:          testmnt-mnt\nsource:          test\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# authorisation\n\nauthorisation in the ripe database is based on the routing policy system security (rpss) that is explained in more detail in rfc 2725.\n\n * authorisation - the power or right to make decisions and have access. this can be delegated.\n * authentication - to ensure that the entity making use of the authorisation is what or who it claims to be.\n * credential - something that shows an entity has a right to exercise authorisation, providing the basis for confidence.\n\nthese three words are often confused. when talking about the ripe database, an authenticated person may be granted or given a credential by a system administrator or official contact, authorising this person to access and manage objects in the database.\n\ndifferent types of objects in the database require different levels of protection. the server supports multiple authorisation methods. because of the data model used by the ripe database, it is not always possible to identify who is making an update. the mntner objects only hold credentials – for example, encrypted password hashes or references to cryptographic keys. there is no connection between many of these credentials and any identifiable person.\n\nin order to make the password tokens a more secure form of protection, the encrypted hashes are hidden from public view. a query on a mntner object will have any password hashes removed in the query result. these hashes can only be seen if you can supply the clear text password as part of the query. the only way to do this via the webupdates form.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# authorisation model\n\nthe mntner objects serve as anonymous containers that hold authorisation credentials. a reference to a mntner object within any object defines authorisation necessary to perform operations on that object or on a set of related objects. such reference is provided by means of several attributes including "mnt-by:", "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:", "mnt-domains:", "mnt-ref:" and "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\nthe mntner object contains one or more mandatory "auth:" attributes. each attribute begins with a keyword identifying the authorisation method followed by the authorisation information or token needed to enforce that method. the irt object also has mandatory "auth:" attributes used for authorisation.\n\nall updates require authorisation. a credential that is valid for one of the authorisation tokens of one of the relevant mntner objects, must be supplied. different methods of authorisation require different authorisation tokens, as shown in the table below of authorisation methods that are currently supported.\n\nvisit this section to know more about mntner object.\n\nauthorisation method   description\nmd5-pw                 this scheme is based on the md5 hash algorithm. the\n                       authorisation information stored in the database is a\n                       passphrase, encrypted using md5-crypt algorithm, which is a\n                       concatenation of the "$1$" string, the salt, and the 128-bit\n                       hash output. because it uses an eight-character salt, a\n                       passphrase of almost unlimited length and the encrypted hash\n                       is hidden from public view, this scheme is quite stable\n                       against dictionary attacks.\n                       \n                       example:\n                       \n                       auth: md5-pw $1$abcd4321$hym/gvhpqxkkimverxxq3z\npgpkey                 this is a strong form of authorisation. the authorisation\n                       information is a signature identity pointing to a public key\n                       certificate, which is stored in a separate key-cert object.\n                       the update is authorised if the transaction is signed by the\n                       corresponding private key. the ripe ncc does not guarantee\n                       that a key belongs to any specific entity. anyone can supply\n                       any public keys, with any ownership information, to the ripe\n                       database. these keys can be used to protect other objects by\n                       checking that the update comes from a user who knows the\n                       corresponding secret key. the database software only allows\n                       current keys (that have not expired) to sign an update\n                       message, and signed messages are only valid for one hour.\n                       \n                       example:\n                       \n                       auth: pgpkey-1380k9u1\nsso                    this scheme is based on the ripe ncc access single sign-on\n                       (sso) system. it takes the management of these authorisation\n                       tokens outside of the ripe database. the authorisation\n                       tokens are managed by the ripe ncc access software. to use\n                       this, you must first create an account with ripe ncc access.\n                       \n                       the sso system was introduced so that when somebody signs in\n                       once with ripe ncc access, that account authorises them to\n                       use certain services that support it, such as webupdates or\n                       the syncupdates web form.\n                       \n                       the credential in the mntner object uses the keyword sso\n                       followed by the email address used to sign in to your sso\n                       account. you can add many different sso credentials to a\n                       mntner object and add your sso credential to as many mntner\n                       objects as you wish (provided you have authority to update\n                       each mntner object using existing authorisation). if you\n                       change your email address in your ripe ncc access\n                       preferences, this will immediately be reflected in any\n                       mntner objects where this access account is referenced.\n                       \n                       authorisation using sso can be done from webupdates and the\n                       syncupdates web form. you can sign into your ripe ncc access\n                       account directly from webupdates and syncupdates. using any\n                       of the update features from webupdates/syncupdates you can\n                       create, modify and delete objects. no password is needed -\n                       you are already authenticated and authorised to make these\n                       updates, assuming the object(s) are maintained by one of\n                       your sso mntner objects.\n                       \n                       example:\n                       \n                       auth: sso dbtest _at_ ripe _dot_ net\nx.509                  this is similar to pgp. you ned a certificate and a private\n                       key. the certificate must be included in a key-cert object.\n                       the update is authorised if the transaction is signed by the\n                       corresponding x.509 private key. the ripe ncc does not\n                       guarantee that a certificate belongs to any specific entity.\n                       anyone can supply any certificate, with any ownership\n                       information, to the ripe database. those certificates can be\n                       used to protect other objects by checking that the update\n                       comes froma user who knows the corresponding private key.\n                       the database software only allows current keys (that have\n                       not expired) to sign an update message, and signed messages\n                       are only valid for one hour.\n                       \n                       example:\n                       \n                       auth: x509-3333\n\n\n# solving authentication problems\n\ngiven the flexibility of the ripe database and the maintainer system, there can be cases where you find yourself unable to authenticate. currently, only certain combinations of authentication and update methods are compatible, as shown in this table:\n\n                             sso   pgp   md5\nwebupdates (web interface)   yes   no    yes*\nemail                        no    yes   yes*\napi                          no    no    yes\nsyncupdates                  no    yes   yes*\n\n*it works, but is not recommended\n\nwe recommend that if you predominantly use the web interface, you only use the sso, and if you mainly use syncupdates or email updates, you use pgp.\n\ndepending on your use case, it is important to carefully consider which authentication method you put on each maintainer you manage. for example, there are three basic situations where authentication might fail when trying to use the web interface:\n\n * the object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer that is not yours. you therefore rightfully do not have access.\n * the object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer with several sso account, none of which are yours. the maintainer also doesn\'t have a shared md5 password that would allow you to authenticate.\n * the object you are trying to modify is protected by a maintainer that only has a pgp key as the authorisation.\n\nfor cases 1 and 2, you need to ask the administrative or technical contact of the maintainer to give you the appropriate access. for case 2, you can use another update method that does support your authentication, such as email.\n\nlastly, in case your maintainer is protected with a md5 password that you forgot, you can reset it here.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# force delete functionality\n\nforce delete allows you to delete inet(6)num, route(6) and domain objects by using the maintainer of a covering address space object, instead of the maintainer of the object itself. this means the "mnt-lower:" of an allocation or the "mnt-by:" of a provider independent (pi) or anycast assignment or legacy under contract, each have the authority to force delete any more specific or related object.\n\nin some cases it can occur that objects in the ripe database that fall under your address space have a maintainer that you do not control. for example, when you give joint control over an object to another user by using their "mnt-by:", you and the other party now have equal permissions. now they have the ability to remove your maintainer from the object and take complete control. another common issue is where an existing route object blocks the creation of a new exact matching route object.\n\nforce delete allows you to remove these objects even though you do not have the credentials for the maintainer on them. instead, you can use the maintainer of the covering address space object, i.e. the "mnt-lower:" of the allocation or the "mnt-by:" of the pi or anycast assignment or legacy under contract.\n\nthere are very strict rules about which objects can be force deleted and whose authorisation is allowed to override the object\'s authorisation. also keep in mind that it is only possible to delete objects: modifying them is not possible.\n\n\n# authorisation to force delete\n\nnormally an object can only be deleted if the operation is authorised by one of the mntner objects in the "mnt-by:" attributes of the object to be deleted. with force delete, the ripe database also looks for the exact match, encompassing, or less specific address space object that was allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc.\n\nthe result is that in addition to the "mnt-by:" attribute of the object itself, the "mnt-lower:" of an allocation or the "mnt-by:" of a pi or anycast assignment or legacy under contract, each have the authority to force delete any more specific or related primary object.\n\n\n# example of force delete\n\nthe force delete functionality only applies to holders of resources that are issued directly by the ripe ncc. in the example below, the mntner object lir-mnt can authorise the deletion of any of the objects shown, except for the allocation object itself. the holder of a sub-allocation does not have the authority to delete an assignment from that sub-allocation. so in this example, sub-mnt cannot be used to delete the assigned pa block.\n\nthe same applies to the route and domain object in this example. even though they fall under the sub-allocation, sub-mnt cannot be used. only lir-mnt can force delete these objects.\n\nallocated pa  \ninetnum: 10.128.0.0 - 10.128.255.255  \nmnt-by: ripe-ncc-hm-mnt  \nmnt-lower: lir-mnt

types can be force deleted by a resource holder. only the following primary object types are covered by this functionality:\n\n * inetnum\n * inet6num\n * route\n * route6\n * domain\n\nfor inetnum and inet6num object types, all objects more specific to an allocation made by the ripe ncc are included, regardless of their status. the parent allocation object itself is not included as it is managed by the ripe ncc. objects related to pi assignments are included but, again, the pi assignments themselves are not included as they are assigned by the ripe ncc. therefore, a resource holder cannot accidentally delete their own resource object.\n\nfor route and route6 object types, any route(6) objects with a prefix exactly matching or more specific to any resource allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc are included. multiple route(6) objects with the same prefix, and different origins, are all included.\n\nreverse delegation domain objects, ending with ip6.arpa or in-addr.arpa, with a prefix exactly matching or more specific to any resource allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc, are included. enum domain objects are not included.\n\nautonomous system number objects are not included. these aut-num objects are resources assigned by the ripe ncc and so can only be deleted by the ripe ncc.\n\nno secondary objects (for example person and role) are included, even if they are directly referenced by any of the primary objects listed above and so would be unreferenced after deleting the primary object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# irt object\n\nirt:

maintainer for that object. this should be a mntner object in the ripe database\n * a key-cert object in the ripe database containing a public pgp key\n * an ip address (range) for which you are responsible as an irt. this should be in the form of an inet(6)num object in the ripe database.\n * any other information that is mandatory for an irt object\n\n# the maintainer (mntner object)\n\na maintainer of an object in the ripe database is an entity, which can alone make changes to that object. a mntner object represents the maintainer. the maintainer authenticates change request either by using a pgp-key, password or sso account as specified in "auth:" attribute.\n\nif you as a team are responsible for a range of ip addresses, there almost certainly will be an inet(6)num object in the database. the maintainer of this object can also maintain your irt object.\n\nthe ripe ncc will not create a mntner object just for maintenance of an irt object.\n\n# the pgp key and the key-cert object\n\na pgp key for secure email communication is mandatory for an irt to create an irt object. before creating one, you will have to create a key-cert object matching your pgp key in the ripe database.\n\nyou can create one by sending a completed template by email to auto-dbm@ripe.net\n\nhere is an example:\n\nkey-cert:     pgpkey-6dfc4771\nmethod:       pgp\nowner:        dfn-cert (2003),

template by e-mail to the ripe ncc. as creation of an irt object is a manual process, you should address your email to ripe-dbm@ripe.net\n\nin your mail, you need to explain why you want to create a new irt object. to prevent misuse of the object, the ripe ncc will need to check your request, so include a full explanation. a good idea is the listing of the inet(6)num objects you, as an irt, are

the file (inetnum.txt.asc) with the pgp key referenced in his mntner object. an alternative would be to send the file, along with this maintainer password to the ripe ncc.\n\nsend this authenticated request to auto-dbm@ripe.net\n\nboth the maintainer of the inet(6)num object and the team who owns the irt object will receive a change notifications by e-mail, when the request has been completed. if there is an error, both will receive a notification.\n\n\n# link more than one inet(6)num object to an irt object\n\n\n# all inet(6)num object have the same maintainer object\n\nyou should collect all the inet(6)num objects into one list. make the appropriate changes and send the change request in one email to auto-dbm@ripe.net.\n\n\n# some inet(6)num objects have different maintainer objects\n\nyou need authorisation from each party involved. you should collect the inet(6)num objects maintained by different maintainers into separate lists. authorise these separately and then send each in a separate email to auto-dbm@ripe.net.\n\n\n# step-by-step guide\n\nhow to link multiple inet(6)num objects with the same maintainer to one single irt object.\n\nextract all the inet(6)num

authenticate the request by either signing the file (inetnum.txt.asc) with the pgp key referenced in his mntner object or send the file, along with his ripe maintainer password to the ripe ncc. the address to use is auto-dbm@ripe.net\n\nboth the maintainer of the inet(6)num object and the team who owns the irt object will receive a change notification by email, when the request has been completed. if there is an error, both will receive a notification.\n\nthis document was first published on the terena website. the author of the original document was: marco thorbrugge, dfn-cert /

of the "member-of:" attribute, the server checks the validity of the membership when creating or modifying a member object. this "member-of:" attribute can be used in route(6), aut-num and inet-rtr objects. the value of the "member-of:" attribute identifies a set object that this object wants to be a member of.\n\nthe set object may also have a related "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute, listing the maintainer of the object that wants to be a member of the set. the membership claim of an object with a "member-of:" attribute must be validated. validation occurs by matching a "mnt-by:" attribute of the object with one of the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes of the set object. if the claim is not valid at the time of creation or modification of a member object (route(6), aut-num or inet-rtr), the operation fails. if a set object has no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the set is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes in the set object. in this case, no other object can validate a claim to be a member of this set. below is an example of "member-of:" usage:\n\naut-num:     as3333\nmember-of:   as-ripe\nmnt-by:      ripe-dbm-mnt\n\nas-set:      as-ripe\nmbrs-by-ref: ripe-dbm-mnt\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# protection of address space\n\nthe inetnum and inet6num objects represent address space allocations and assignments. the "mnt-lower:" attribute is used to reference a mntner object that authorises the creation of more specific inetnum or inet6num objects. if no "mnt-lower:" attribute is present, one of the "mnt-by:" attributes of the parent object will be used instead.\n\nthis parent authorisation is only required when an inetnum or inet6num object is created. this authorisation is in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# protection of aut-num object space\n\nprotection of aut-num object space is done using as-block objects. the mntner object that authorises the creation of aut-num objects is specified by any one of the "mnt-lower:" attributes of the parent as-block object. when no "mnt-lower:" attribute exists, the mntner object from any one of the parent "mnt-by:" attributes is used.\n\nthis parent authorisation is only required when an aut-num object is created. it is in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# protection of objects with hierarchical names\n\nrpsl set objects do not have a natural hierarchy of their own but allow hierarchical names, such as the as-set object. an as-set object may have a non-hierarchical name such as "as-foo" or a hierarchical name in the form "as1:as-bar".\n\nfor set objects with non-hierarchical names, authorisation corresponds to the rules for individual objects described in the section \'security of data using authorisation\'.\n\nif hierarchical names are used, then the creation of an object must be authorised by the object whose primary key is named by everything to the left of the rightmost colon in the primary key name of the object being created. consider the object "as1:as-bar:as2". this would need to be authorised by "as1:as-bar". this object is considered to be the \'parent\' of the object being created.\n\nhierarchical authorisation is determined by first using any mntner object referenced by the parent object\'s "mnt-lower:" attributes. if none of these exist, then any mntner object referenced by the parent object\'s "mnt-by:" attributes is used.\n\nthe parent authorisation is required in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself and is only required when an object is created.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# protection of person and role objects\n\nwhen "mnt-by:" was made mandatory on these objects a circular dependency was created. a person object must be maintained and a mntner must reference an existing person. therefore, a new user who has no data in the ripe database must follow the procedure in the section, \'new organisation startup\' to get started.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# protection of reverse delegation objects\n\nprotection of the reverse domain object space for "in-addr.arpa" and "ip6.arpa" domains is done with separate methods for creation, deletion and modification. the domain object creation is described in a flow chart.\n\nthe creation of domain objects for "in-addr.arpa" and "ip6.arpa" domains must satisfy several authorisation criteria. as with all objects, it must satisfy its own mntner object references in the "mnt-by:” attributes. it must also satisfy a hierarchical authorisation. both authorisations must be passed for the object to be created. for modification and deletion of a domain object, only its own mntner object in the "mnt-by:" attributes needs to authorise the operation. where a deletion fails, mntner objects referenced in a "mnt-domains", "mnt-lower" or "mnt-by" attribute of the corresponding inet(6)num object can authorise the deletion. they will be checked in this order. the first attribute type found will be taken as the only one to use.\n\nthe hierarchical authorisation uses the related address space objects. an address space object (inetnum or inet6num) with an exact matching prefix will be used; otherwise a less specific prefix is used. one of these objects will always be found in the database. following this order, the first valid object found is the one used to authorise the new object creation. if the supplied credentials do not satisfy the authorisation required by this first valid object found, then authorisation fails. the software does not look for the next possible valid object in the sequence.\n\nthere is no hierarchy allowed in the reverse domain objects. therefore, no hierarchical authorisation is required from the domain objects, as is also the case for route objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# protection of route(6) object space\n\nthe route(6) object creation must satisfy several authorisation criteria. as with all objects, it must satisfy its own mntner object references in the "mnt-by:" attributes. it must also satisfy two separate hierarchical authorisations. all three authorisations must be passed for the object to be created. for modify and delete of a route(6) object, only its own mntner object in the "mnt-by:" attributes needs to authorise the operation.\n\naddress space: the creation of a route(6) object needs to be authorised either by existing, related route(6) objects or related address space objects. the route(6) objects are checked first. if a route(6) object with an exact matching address prefix exists, it will be used for authorisation. if this does not exist, one with a less specific prefix is used. if no such route(6) object exists, an address space object (inetnum or inet6num) with an exact matching prefix will be used, otherwise a less specific prefix is used. one of these objects will always be found in the database. following this order, the first valid object found is the one used to authorise the new object creation. if the supplied credentials do not satisfy the authorisation required by this first valid object found, then authorisation fails. the software does not look for the next possible valid object in the sequence.\n\nautonomous system (as) number: you do not need to authenticate against the origin as number when creating a route(6) object. any originating as number can be used, so long as it’s not in reserved space. the originating as number does not need to exist in the ripe database.\n\nthe origin as holder is notified of a route(6) creation, using the "notify:" attribute on the aut-num object, if the both the as number exists and the "notify:" attribute is set.\n\nthe ripe database is used as an inter-routing registry. however, it is only possible to create a route(6) object in the ripe database with an origin prefix that has been allocated to the ripe region.\n\n\n# authorisation rules for creating route objects\n\nthe irr that the ripe ncc operated is tightly coupled with the ripe database, which contains resource and contact information for the address space and asns that the ripe ncc manages. this means that when you query for a certain resource in the ripe database, you will also get relevant results from the irr. conversely, when entering data into irr, authorisation for the relevant ripe database objects is required.\n\nto create a route(6) (i.e. a route or route(6)) object in the ripe database, you must authenticate against the address space you are referring to. only address space within the ripe region can be referred to.\n\nwhen creating a route(6) object you must authenticate against multiple maintainers to verify that you have control over the address space you are referring to. this means the related inet(6)num object must exist in the ripe database and you can authenticate against it, before you can create a route(6) object in the irr.\n\nwhen you submit a new route(6) object, the following validation process is triggered:\n\n * the maintainer of any existing route(6) object that is exactly matching or covering a less specific prefix is checked. if there is none, the maintainer of the inet(6)num object that is exactly matching or covering a less specific prefix is checked.\n * if successful, the maintainer of the route(6) object you are creating is verified.\n\nthe order in which the ripe database will verify available maintainers is:\n\n * mnt-routes\n * mnt-lower\n * mnt-by\n\nthis means that if a route(6) or inet(6)num object has all three kinds of maintainers defined, you must use the "mnt-routes:" attributes to authenticate. in this case, you cannot use the "mnt-lower:" or "mnt-by:" attributes. likewise, if you have a "mnt-lower:" and a "mnt-by:" attribute on the objects, the "mnt-lower:" attribute must be used.\n\nhere is a flowchart outlining the entire authorisation process.\n\nyou can only create a route(6) object for a prefix you manage. if these objects are maintained by your organisation\'s single shared maintainer, you just need to supply one credentials to satisfy all of the requirements. however, when you use multiple maintainers, you may need to supply different credentials to create a single route(6) objects.\n\nif you wish to avoid having to supply multiple credentials, it is best to set up hierarchical authorisation by adding a "mnt-routes:" attribute to all of your resource objects and consistently use this maintainer to create and manage route(6) objects.\n\n\n# creating route objects referring to resources you don\'t manage\n\nyou do not need to authenticate against the origin as number when creating a route(6) object. any originating as number can be used, so long as it\'s not in reserved space. the originating as number does not have to exist in the ripe database.\n\nif the originating as number exists in the ripe database, and if the aut-num object contains one or more notify: attributes, these will be used to notify the originating as number holder when the route(6) object is created.\n\n\n# creating route objects for out-of-region (non-ripe) resources\n\nit is not possible to create a route(6) object in the ripe routing registry that refers to a prefix that is not managed by the ripe ncc, but by one of the other regional internet registries.\n\nthis change was introduced by nwi-5, which is documented in a ripe labs article: out-of-region route(6) and aut-num objects in the ripe database.\n\n\n# force deleting blocking route objects\n\nwhen the ripe database gets authorisation from the address space for the creation your new route(6) object, it will first check if there is an exact matching or less specific route(6) object. if this route object has a maintainer that you do not have the credentials for, it can block you from creating a new route(6) object. in this case you, as the resource holder, can simply delete the blocking route(6) object.\n\nnormally an object can only be deleted if the operation is authorised by one of the maintainers in the "mnt-by:" attributes of the object to be deleted. however, the force delete functionality also looks for the exact matching, encompassing or less specific address space object that was co-maintained by the ripe ncc in the hierarchy of the object that is to be deleted. co-maintained objects include resources that were allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc, and also legacy resources under contract.\n\nthe result is that the "mnt-lower:" attribute of an allocation, or the "mnt-by:" attribute of a pi or anycast assignment, has the authority to reclaim any more specific or related object. practically, this means a route object can be deleted by:\n\n * the mnt-by: attribute of the route object\n * the mnt-routes: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc\n * the mnt-lower: attribute of the parent inet(6)num that was allocated or assigned by the ripe ncc\n\nit is important to understand that this functionality only works when the parent inet(6)num object is protected by the ripe-ncc-hm-mnt or ripe-ncc-legacy-mnt maintainer. if not, the system will look up in the hierarchy until it finds an inet(6)num which has a ripe ncc maintainer on it, after which it will look at the "mnt-lower:" or "mnt-routes:" attributes on that inet(6)num object and use them for the authentication.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# referencing an irt object\n\nthe irt object can be referenced in inetnum and inet6num objects. this reference is made by adding an optional "mnt-irt:" attribute to the inet(6)num object with the value set to the name of the irt object. adding a reference to an irt object requires authorisation from the irt object. authorisation can be approved by any of the credentials referenced in any of the "auth:" attributes of the irt object. the authorisation will not default to the "mnt-by:" attributes of the irt object if no suitable credential is found in the "auth:" attributes, and, in this case, the update will fail.\n\nauthorisation from the irt object is only required when a "mnt-irt:" attribute is added to a referencing object, either on creation or by modification. the irt authorisation is required in addition to the authorisation of the individual object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# referencing an organisation object\n\nthe organisation object can be referenced in any object. this reference is made by adding an optional "org:" attribute to the referencing object, along with the name of the organisation object. adding this reference requires authorisation from the organisation object. authorisation can be approved by any of the mntner objects referenced in any of the "mnt-ref:" attributes of the organisation object. the authorisation will not default to the "mnt-by:" attributes if no suitable maintainer is found in the "mnt-ref:" attributes and, in this case, the update will fail.\n\nauthorisation from the organisation object is only required when an "org:" attribute is added to a referencing object, either on creation or by modification. this is in addition to the authorisation of the referencing object itself.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# dnssec delegations\n\nthis procedure is in addition to the normal procedure for requesting reverse delegations.\n\n\n# the domain object\n\nyou can request reverse delegation by submitting domain objects. dnssec will not mean any change the existing authorisation mechanisms. the delegation checker will only carry out dnssec specific tests if dnssec related information is being exchanged.\n\nto allow for the exchange of dnssec related information, the domain object now includes a "ds-rdata:" attribute.\n\n\n# delegation checks\n\nwhen it receives an update, the update engine will perform a number of checks. these are the most important:\n\n * is there a matching dnskey available in the dns for each "ds-rdata:" attribute that is submitted in the domain object?\n * is there a valid rrsig made with the dnskey matching the "ds-rdata:"? - the resolution protocol needs this, without it the update will fail.\n * does the dnskey has its "sep" flag set? setting the sep flag is not mandatory. if it is not set, a warning will be produced, however the "ds-rdata:" content will still be copied to the zone.\n * is the signature validity period close to expiring and are the times to live (ttls) a reasonable fraction of the signature validity period? we suggest the maximum zone ttl of your zone data to be a fraction of your signature validity period. if the ttl would be of similar order as the signature validity period, then all rrsets fetched during the validity period would be cached until the signature expiration time. section 7.1 of resource records for the dns security extension suggests that "the resolver may use the time remaining before expiration of the signature validity period of a signed rrset as an upper bound for the ttl". as a result query load on authoritative servers would peak at signature expiration time, as this is also the time at which records simultaneously expire from caches. to avoid query load peaks we suggest the ttl on all the rrs in your zone to be at least a few times smaller than your signature validity period. we currently test on the ttl being at least two times smaller than the signature validity period.\n\nthese tests will only be done for "ds-rdata:" attributes using supported digest types, [section 5.1.3 from rfc4033] (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4033.txt). a zonemaster check determines whether the digest type is supported.\n\nif the "ds-rdata:" attribute uses an unsupported digest type, you will see a warning message, however the "ds-rdata:" content will still be copied into the parent zone.\n\nnote: the domain objects wizard in the webupdates does not support requesting dnssec delegations yet. however, you will be able to use webupdates to add the "ds-rdata:" attribute to an existing domain object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# request enum delegation\n\nenum is a protocol that is the result of work of the internet engineering task force\'s (ietf\'s) telephone number mapping working group. the charter of this working group was to define a domain name system (dns)-based architecture and protocols for mapping a telephone number to a uniform resource identifier (uri) which can be used to contact a resource associated with that number.\n\nthe ripe ncc provides dns operations for e164.arpa zone(enum) is accordance with the instructions from the internet architecture board.\n\n\n# requesting secure delegation in the enum domain\n\nexample of an enum domain object, including a "ds-rdata:" attribute\n\ndomain:     1.3.e164.arpa\ndescr:      stichting enum

setup you server to serve a secure zone\n    \n    ensure that the zone you are serving is signed and it contains a key signing key (ksk) marked with the sep flag.\n\n 2. create your domain object\n    \n    the "ds-rdata:" attribute of your domain object should be created by performing a hash over the sep ksk key. an easy way to create a domain object which includes the ds-rdata: hash is to visit the ripe ncc delegation checker, input your zone name and follow the instructions provided. the end result will be a domain object you can use in the next step.\n\n 3. submitting the domain object once you have set up your sever(s) to serve the enum zones you are ready to request delegation by submitting a domain object:\n    \n    1. by using webupdates\n       \n       * first authorise yourself in the authorisation section. then go to the add section\n       * select domain, by clicking on \'create a new object\' and then click on \'add object\'\n       * fill in all the available fields\n       * use the \'add new field\' feature to add at least two "nserver:" attributes. here, you supply the names of the name servers that are serving the zones as set up in step 3 and that you have specified in the ns resource records of those zones\n       * for the "mnt-by:" attribute use the mntner you prepared in step 1\n    \n    2. by email you need to create a domain object containing information about the zone you need reverse delegation for. for further information go here\n    \n    3. verifying the setup once you have submitted the domain object you will receive a notification.\n       \n       you should then be able to query for your object in the ripe database: whois -h whois.ripe.net 1.3.e164.arpa after the object appears in the ripe database it may take between 15 and 60 minutes before the delegation information is available in the dns.\n       \n       the ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n       \n       please contact us if, six hours after the appearance of your domain object in the database, your delegation does not appear. include the details such as name server addresses and the domain object in your request. also include the full response, including headers, as received from the database.\n       \n       any resolver which has the dnssec public key for e164.arpa configured should now return dns answers which have the authenticated data bit set.\n\n\n# additional notes\n\nfrom time to time, you may have to roll the keys in your zone. when you do this, make sure that you also update the ds-rdata information. this places a new ds record in the parent zone.\n\nfor further details on rolling keys and other important information on dnssec operational practices we recommend reading rfc 4641.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# security of data using authorisation\n\nindividual data objects must be protected with a mntner object. the mntner is referenced by the "mnt-by:" attribute in the object. this attribute is defined as multiple in all object types, so several mntner objects can be used to protect one object.\n\nonly those mntner objects referenced by the "mnt-by:" attributes are authorised to modify or delete the object. authorisation checks work in line with the logical “or” - for the operation to be authorised, you must supply information required by at least one credential from one of the referenced mntner objects. as you can supply information required by any credential for the operation to be authorised, this means that an object\'s protection level is determined by the weakest authorisation method used in the mntner objects referenced by that object.\n\nwhen the "mnt-by:" attribute is added to an object for the first time (as part of object creation or modification), the operation should pass authorisation checks for at least one of the mntner objects referenced by one of the "mnt-by:" attributes.\n\nif the operation is a modification and the old object already has one or more "mnt-by:" attributes, then one of the mntner objects referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes in the old object must authorise the change. if the old object does not have any "mnt-by:" attributes, then one of the mntner objects referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes in the new object must authorise the change. all new objects must have at least one "mnt-by:". there are still some historic person and role objects that do not have any "mnt-by:" attributes.\n\nauthorisation is also used in a hierarchical way. much of the operational data in the ripe database is structured hierarchically. for example, the address space is allocated in large blocks, which can then be divided in a number of ways and then finally assigned to end users. authorisation in a hierarchy works from the top down to the bottom. so each child object needs to be authorised by the holder of the parent object. there are a range of additional attributes for this including "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:".\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# using the authorisation methods\n\n * md5 password\n * pgp key\n * x.509 certificate\n * single sign-on\n\n\n# md5 password\n\nan md5 password can be used by any of the update methods currently in use. see section 5.2 update methods for more details of these methods.\n\nfor email updates, password authorisation information is supplied using a "password:" pseudo-attribute. the value of this attribute is a clear-text passphrase, corresponding to the encrypted hash. it can appear anywhere in the body of the message, but not within mail headers. line continuation is not allowed for this attribute. the attribute and the passphrase should fit on one line. if you split the passphrase across multiple lines, this will be treated as a syntax error. if you have a very long passphrase, please note that some email clients split lines at a pre-defined character position. if multiple passwords are required, a "password:" pseudo-attribute must be included in the update for each password. the webupdates web form includes a ‘session passwords\' field. many passwords can be added, one at a time, using this field, up to a pre-defined limit. for any update in this session, all session passwords will be added to the update that is performed via the web form.\n\nin the single text area form of webupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added as part of the update body, in the text area, in the same way as with an email update. the session passwords also apply in this case.\n\nusing the syncupdates web form there is no ‘session passwords\' field but again the "password:" pseudo-attribute can be added. when using the http post and get requests for syncupdates, the "password:" pseudo-attribute must be supplied as part of the message body.\n\nwith the restful api, any required passwords must be included in the uri query parameters. for more details see the api documentation.\n\n\n# pgp key\n\nto use pgp authentication you must first create a private/public key pair. there are many third-party applications that will allow you to do this. you must keep the private key secure. the public key is entered into the ripe database in a key-cert object. (see \'description of the key-cert object\' for details.)\n\nsome email clients allow you to import your private key into the client. this can then be used to sign any email update you submit. alternatively, you can use third-party software to sign an update with your private key and paste the signed update into the body of an email.\n\na signed update message can also be pasted into the syncupdates web form. when using the http post and get requests for syncupdates, the signed update must be supplied in the message body.\n\npgp-signed updates cannot be submitted using the restful api. as webupdates uses the api in the background, you cannot paste a signed update into a webupdates text area either.\n\nfor your pgp-signed update to pass authentication checks, you must have your public key in the database in a key-cert object.\n\npgp authentication creation steps are in the appendix.\n\n\n# use in the maintainer object\n\npgp authentication can be activated by setting the value of an "auth:" attribute to pgpkey-<id> where <id> is the pgp key id to be used for authentication. this string is the same one which is used in the corresponding key-cert object\'s "key-cert:" attribute.\n\nremember that if you have multiple "auth:" attributes in a maintainer or if you have multiple "mnt-by:" attributes in an object, all possible authentication methods are combined by a logical or which means that any single one of the specified authentication methods can be used. there is not security advantage in using pgp authentication with an object which can also be updated with password authentication.\n\nthere are currently no referential integrity checks carried out on the "auth:" attribute values. if you change your "auth:" to refer to a non existent key-cert object, or someone else\'s key-cert object you have locked your mntner. you will then have to contact us for assistance to un-lock it. also, if you delete your key-cert object you will again lock your mntner until you re-create the key-cert object.\n\nthis is an example of a valid mntner object which uses pgp authentication:\n\nmntner:         example-mnt\ndescr:          example maintainer\nadmin-c:        joe1-ripe\nupd-to:         joe@example.net\nauth:           pgpkey-4b8ae00d\nmnt-by:         example-mnt\ncreated:        2022-10-26t11:38:51z\nlast-modified:  2022-10-26t11:38:51z\nsource:         ripe\n\n\n\n# using authentication when sending updates\n\npgp signed updates can be sent to the database simply by signing the body of the message containing the updates and sending it to the server. remember to use ascii armoring.\n\nmultiple gp-signed and non-signed parts can be supplied in a single update message, each part is processed separately. you can supply several objects which are protected by different pgp keys in a single update message, providing all required signatures are present.\n\npgp parts with invalid signatures are handled as plain text. if the object is protected by an authentication method other than pgp, or has multiple authentication schemes in use and the required authentication is present, it will still be authorised. if pgp is the only form of authentication present the authentication will fail.\n\npgp authentication can be mixed with any of the other forms of authentication in the same mntner object. each authentication method used can have multiple instances present. all the authentications present in a mntner object are processed with a logical \'or\' to determine if the authentication is passed.\n\npgp can be used with updates submitted by e-mail or using the syncupdates facility. it cannot be used with the webupdates interface.\n\n\n# x.509 certificate\n\nthis is handled in a similar way to pgp. you need a certificate and private key. there is third-party software available to generate these as well as command-line tools, for example openssl. the certificate must be included in a key-cert object in the database. the generated certificate and private key are in binary files. the openssl tool will convert the certificate into plain text to be included in the key-cert object. for x.509 key-cert objects, you must specify the "key-cert:" value as ‘auto-1\'. the database software will then set this value. these values cannot be reused. once deleted, an x.509 key-cert object cannot be recreated.\n\nif your email client supports s/mime you can import the certificate and private key into the client. email updates can now be signed with your x.509 private key. alternatively, you can sign your update using your private key with openssl and paste it into the email message body.\n\na signed update message can also be pasted into the syncupdates web form. when using the http post and get requests for syncupdates, the signed update must be supplied in the message body.\n\nx.509 signed updates cannot be submitted via the restful api. additionally, since webupdates utilizes the api in the background, you are unable to paste a signed update into a webupdates text area. however, you can submit updates through the restful api using client certificate authentication.\n\nfor your x.509 signed update to pass authorisation checks, you must have your certificate in the database in a key-cert object.\n\n\n# single sign-on\n\nthe sso (single sign-on) authorisation is different to all the other methods. this one provides some authentication as well. sso is based on ripe ncc access. to use sso as an authorisation method in the ripe database, you must first create a ripe ncc access account. this provides some details about who you are. it is no longer a totally anonymous password in a box (where the box is the mntner object).\n\nthe ripe ncc access account username, which is your email address, becomes the authorisation credential used by the database software. if you change your ripe ncc access username to a different email address, this is immediately reflected in the mntner object.\n\ncurrently sso authorisation only works with web-based update methods. this includes webupdates and the syncupdates web form. you need to sign in to your ripe ncc access account in order to authorise an update.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# available databases\n\nan update is the submission of information for entry into, or removal from, a database. as the database records are rpsl objects, these updates create, modify or delete one or more objects.\n\nthere are several databases that can be updated and a number of ways in which you can submit an update. each of the databases described below have a fully operating software system built around them. this includes the core database software as well as the external interfaces, for example email service, webupdates, syncupdates and restful api.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# experimental databases\n\nthere are times when some features need to be deployed in a proof of concept mode. it may be an idea that some community users have suggested but does not yet have widespread support. a proof of concept software release can be made and a temporary database, similar to the rc database, set up to demonstrate the feature. that database will be a full copy of the production database with dummified personal data and modified mntner object credentials.\n\nsimilar projects may be set up when a major data migration project is proposed. a test run may be carried out on a database copy and this may be made available to the community to review what their data looks like after the change.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# release candidate database (rc)\n\nthe release procedure for new software requires the new system to be available in a test environment for a period of time. this test environment is built around the rc database. this is a fully functioning service where all your client software can be tested against the new software release. the rc database is dummified to remove personal data. also all mntner object authorisation tokens are set to a password using the mntner object name. this allows more flexibility, as you can create objects that are only created by the ripe ncc in the production version, other than that, it is an exact copy of the production database, with the copy made at some point in time close to the software release date.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# ripe database\n\nthe ripe database is the authoritative database and is sometimes referred to as the ‘live’ or ‘production’ database or service. this holds all the current data for all the existing rpsl objects. it also holds historical data for deleted objects and previous versions of the current objects. most operational services and tools are built around this database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# test database\n\nthis database is provided as an operational service to all users. it allows anyone to try out updates or changes to their data. new users can set up any data they like and practise making updates and doing queries.\n\nthe test database works in exactly the same way as the production service, for most of its operations. some rules are relaxed and some mntner objects have the password included in a "remarks:" attribute. this allows users to create objects in this test database that only the ripe ncc can create in the production database. if you want to copy your allocation and build a copy of your network you can do this in the test database.\n\neach evening, at midnight (utc) the whole contents of this database are deleted. it is then reset with a standard, basic set of objects. this prevents anyone from creating large objects and blocking off huge pieces of the address space. so if you are testing anything that will take you more than a day to complete, you need to build your objects in a text file that you can either paste into a syncupdates web page or submit as an email update. make sure you order them in the text file to match how you actually created them. if you get the order wrong, some may fail when you re-submit them. you can add to the text file as you create or change data in the database. then the next day, you can recreate the whole set of objects to the point you reached previously and continue with your tests.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# database support\n\n\n# ripe database support\n\nthe ripe database contains registration details of ip addresses and as numbers originally allocated by the ripe ncc. it shows the organisations that hold the resources, where the allocations were made, and contact details for the networks.\n\n\n# problems with spam?\n\nwhat can the ripe ncc do about spam? who can i report this to? how do i take things further? what you can do about network abuse\n\n\n# database working group\n\nthe database working group deals with all issues related to the ripe database. changes of existing objects, creation of new objects and features, and distribution of databases and security issues are discussed here. join the working group\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# clean-up of unreferenced data\n\n\n# introduction\n\nany data entered into the ripe database must comply with the ripe database terms and conditions. over a period of time, data is changed and references are removed. this often results in many of the secondary objects (for example organisation, person, role and mntner objects) being left in the database and serving no useful purpose. in order to keep the database clean and to comply with data protection rules, this unnecessary data must be removed. new personal data should not be stored in the ripe database beyond a reasonable "work in progress" period before it is referenced by operation data objects.\n\n\n# authority\n\ncleaning up this data has been discussed many times at ripe meetings and on the mailing list of the ripe database working group\n\nthe authority to clean-up this data was first given to the ripe ncc at the ripe 40 meeting in prague in 2001\n\nthe scope was expanded at the ripe 41 meeting in amsterdam in 2002\n\na clean-up process to do periodic clean-ups was put in place in 2003. however, this process proved to be inadequate and the number of unreferenced objects continued to grow.\n\nthe issue was raised again at the ripe 54 meeting in tallinn in 2007, continued on the ripe database working group mailing list throughout 2007 and then consensus was reached at the ripe 56 meeting in berlin in 2008.\n\n\n# process\n\na simplistic implementation that cleaned up unreferenced person and role objects was started on 26 january 2009. however, since this approach was incomplete (e.g. it did not detect person-maintainer pairs as described below) it was largely ineffective. the process was therefore stopped again on 21 march 2014.\n\nsince 6 september 2016 the ripe ncc has implemented a more complete clean-up process for the following object types:\n\n * organisation\n * person\n * role\n * mntner\n\nif the organisation, person or role object is unreferenced, it is eligible to be deleted. if a person or role object is only referenced in a mntner object and the mntner object only references that person or role object, then both the mntner and the person or role objects are eligible to be deleted.\n\nto be deleted, they must be unreferenced by any other object, and must not have been referenced by any aut-num, domain, inet(6)num, route(6), as-set, filter-set, inet-rtr, peering-set, route-set, rtr-set, as-block, key-cert or irt object during the last 90 days.\n\nnotifications of the deletion of objects will be sent to anyone who has optionally included a "notify:" attribute in the person, role or mntner objects, or a "mnt-nfy:" attribute in the mntner objects. these notifications include a link to this page.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# configuring reverse dns\n\ncomputer networks use the domain name system (dns) to determine the ip address associated with a domain name. this process is also known as forward dns resolution. reverse dns (rdns) is the inverse process of this: the resolution of an ip address to its designated domain name. this document explains how reverse dns works and how to configure it for your zone\n\n\n# reverse dns overview\n\nthe reverse dns database of the internet works with a hierarchical tree of servers, just like forward dns. it is rooted in the address and routing parameter area (arpa) top-level domain of the internet. one level below the arpa root are the delegated servers in-addr.arpa for ipv4 and ip6.arpa for ipv6.\n\nfurther down the tree, there are delegations for the /8 blocks that iana allocated to the rirs, the allocations that the rirs gave to the address holders, all the way down to the individual ip addresses and names that you have configured for your internet-enabled hosts. the process of reverse resolving an ip address uses the pointer dns record type (ptr record).\n\n\n\nin order to do a dns lookup for data that is associated with a certain ip address, you should map the ip addresses into the dns name hierarchy. this means that, as an address holder, you will have to configure two things. forst, you have to configure your zone for reverse dns. second, you have to request reverse delegation of your zone. the second part is one by creating a domain bject in the ripe database.\n\nbefore you can submit the domain object to the ripe database, you will first have to configure reverse dns for your zone on at least two name servers. upon submission, the ripe database will perform checks to see if your name servers are configured properly. if so, delegation will be propagated to the dns by the ripe ncc\'s name servers.\n\n\n# mapping ip addresses into the dns name hierarchy\n\nfor ipv4, the mapping of the reverse address space can only happen on "byte" boundaries, i.e. multiples of 8 bits. this means that you should take the four octets - the decimal numbers between the dots - of an ip address range, put them in reverse order and then map them into the in-addr.arpa domain.\n\nfor example, an address (a) record for mail.example.com points to the ip address 192.0.2.5. in pointer record of the reverse database, this ip address is stored as the domain name 5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. pointing back to its designated host name mail.example.com. the resulting ptr record would look like this:\n\n5.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. 3600 in ptr mail.example.com\n\n\nreverse dns for ipv6 uses the hexadecimal notation on "nibble" boundaries, i.e. multiples of 4 bits. this means you should take the ipv6 address, expand all the zerps, put each hexadecimal number in reverse order and map them into the ip6.arpa domain.\n\nfor example, the pointer domain name corresponding to the ipv6 address 2001:db8::567:89ab is b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa., which would result in this ptr record:\n\nb.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. 3600 in ptr mail.example.com.\n\n\n\n# dealing with multiple zones for one address block\n\nbecause the particular mapping delegation of reverse address space can only happen on byte boundaries for ipv4 and nibble boundaries for ipv6, you could be dealing with multiple zones for one address block.\n\nipv4 one or more /24 type zones need to be created if your address space has a prefix length between /17 and /24. if your prefix length is between /16 and /9 you will have to request one or more delegations for /16 type zones.\n\nfor example, if you have been allocated 10.155.16.0/22, you need to create four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nipv6 if you have been allocated an ipv6 block that is not on a nibble boundary, you will need to go down to the next nibble and create multiple zones to cover the entire block.\n\nfor example, an allocation such as 2001:db8::/29 will result in eight reverse zones of /32 each:\n\n8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n9.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\na.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nb.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nc.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nd.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\ne.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\nf.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.\n\n\n\n# creating domain objects for reverse dns\n\n\n# step 1: set up authorisation\n\nthe creation and maintenance of domain objects must be handled by a designated maintainer. you can use an existing maintainer or create a specific one for the people who will be creating and managing domain objects. you should refer to this maintainer using the "mnt-domains:" attribute in inetnum object for the address block that you hold. you will be able to add the "mnt-domains:" attribute in the ripe database, for example using webupdates. if you are an lir, you may need to select your default maintainer first, before you can add this attribute.\n\n\n# step 2: configure your dns server\n\nconfigure your dns servers in such a way that you will pass all the tests that we will perform. here are some recommendations to help you:\n\n * make sure you set up at least two name servers that are authoritative for the zone\n * ensure that the servers are at least in different subnets, but preferably in different networks that are geographically distributed.\n * the resolvable names of these name servers should be in the ns resource records of the zone.\n * the soa resource record (rr) should have the same content, both serial number and other data, on all the name servers.\n * the soa should contain a valid "rname" (the contact address)\n * the timing parameters should be reasonable\n\nwhen you are satisfied with your configuration, we recommend that you perform a test fo your setup using the dnscheck tool so you can find and resolve any problems.\n\n\n# step 3a: create your domain objects using webupdates\n\nwhen you submit a domain object you are requesting reverse delegation, asking the ripe ncc to enter ns records pointing to your name servers in ripe ncc\'s parent zone. the domain object has the following mandatory attributes:\n\ndomain:   <zone name>\nadmin-c:  <nic-handle for administrative contact>\ntech-c:   <nic-handle for technical contact>\nzone-c:   <nic-handle for zone contact>\nnserver:  <primary name server>\nnserver:  <secondary name server>\nmnt-by:   <your maintainer>\nsource:   ripe\n\n\nin the web interface for the ripe database, there is a wizard that will automatically create one or more domain objects for you. it allows you to fill in an ipv4 or ipv6 prefix and the wizard will take care of creating one or multiple reverse zones out of it. after filling in your name servers, the wizard will also perform a basic check to see if the name servers are online. the full set of tests will happen after you submit the form. a one-minute video with a demonstration is available online.\n\n\n\nafter you have entered all of the required fields you can submit the form. depending on the amount of domain objects that are going to be created, it can take up to several minutes for the process to complete. the tests return log level information, categorised as info, notice, warning, error and critical. we reject any update that has error or critical for any test. if this happens to you, resolve the problem and try completing the wizard again.\n\nif the update was successful, the success page will show you the first couple of domain objects that were created, along with a link to the full list. still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the dns. the ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# step 3b: create your domain objects using syncupdates, email or the api\n\nif you choose to create domain objects using syncupdates, email or the api, you will first need to chop your address block into "chunks" that can be delegated. for example, if you have been allocated 10.155.16/22, you need to create four reverse zones:\n\n16.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n17.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n18.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n19.155.10.in-addr.arpa.\n\n\nin the "domain:" attribute, you specify the name of the reverse zone, e.g. "16.155.10.in-addr.arpa". as discussed, you will have to do this for each "chunk" you have created. if you need reverse delegation for a /22 block, you will need to create four domain objects, one for each /24.\n\nenter all other attributes and submit your domain object to the ripe database. after verifying syntax and authorisation, we will perform a number of tests to see if you configured reverse dns correctly. the tests return log level information, categorised as info, notice, warning, error and critical. we reject any update that has error or critical for any test. if this happens to you, resolve the problem and try submitting the domain object again.\n\nif the update was successful, you should then be able to query for your object in the ripe database. still, it may take up to 24 hours before the delegation information is available in the dns. the ultimate test is to query a recursive name server that is not authoritative for your zone for a record from your zone.\n\n\n# requesting dnssec delegations\n\nto allow for the exchange of dnssec-related information, the domain object includes a "ds-rdata:" attribute.\n\nin dnssec, the delegation signer (ds) resource record is created from a dnskey resource record by comparing it with the public key. the parent publishes the ds resource record. the "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the rdata of the ds resource records related to the domain, as shown in the "domain:" attribute.\n\nds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278bf194c29a812b33935bb2517e17d1486210fa\n\n\nthe tools provided with bind (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. you should copy the ds rdata into the "ds-data:" attributes.\n\nwhen we receive a domain object with dnssec-related information, we will carry out additional tests.\n\n\n# automated update of dnssec delegations\n\nwhenever you want to change the dnssec key whose digest is in the "ds-rdata:" attribute, it is necessary to update the attribute. this can be done manually using any means of ripe database update methods or automatically using a special child delegation signed (cds) dns record. this procedure works as follows:\n\n * the reverse domain has to be already dnssec-secured.\n * whenever a change in "ds-rdata:" attribute is required, you should publish a cds record at the apex (root) of your reverse zone.\n * ripe ncc regularly scans all dnssec-secured reverse domains for cds records.\n * if a cds record is found whose contents differ from the current "ds-rdata:" attribute and all safety measures (see below) are fulfilled, ripe ncc will update the domain object on your behalf.\n\nthere are some additional requirements mandated by rfc 7344 in order to ensure the process is hardened against accidents and abuse:\n\n * the cds record set is properly signed by a key represented in the ds record of the parent zone. this usually means that the cds record set has to be signed by key-signing key (ksk) instead of zone-signing key (zsk).\n * applying the cds record must not break the dnssec delegation. therefore for each dnssec algorithm present in the cds record set, there has to be at least one matching key in the dnskey record set with a proper signature.\n * the inception date of the dnssec signature of the cds record set must not be older than the date stored in the "last- modified:" attribute of the domain object.\n\nit is also possible to switch to insecure delegation by publishing a special cds record containing "0 0 0 00". please note that this is a one way process. once the reverse domain is switched to insecure, you have to add the "ds-rdata:" attribute manually to activate dnssec again.\n\n\n# reverse dns troubleshooting\n\nhere is an overview of the most common warnings and errors that the reverse delegation checker reports, along with the likely causes and suggested solutions.\n\nerror                                                         likely cause and suggested

function or operational unit, not an individual person, and contains information about a technical or administrative contact that are responsible for the object where it is referenced. each role object has a unique nic handle ("nic-hdl:").\n\n\n# what is a nic handle?\n\nnic handles are unique identifiers of roles.\n\nit is basically the role\'s unique id and it helps to keep different roles with the same name apart from each other.\n\nwhenever a role object is referenced in another object they are referenced by their nic handle ("nic-hdl:") and not by their name.\n\n\n# what is a mntner (pronounced "maintainer")?\n\nall objects in the ripe database must be protected using mntner objects. a mntner object specifies authentication information required to authorise creation, deletion or modification of the objects protected by the mntner.\n\nthe value of the "mnt-by" attribute is the name of the maintainer (mntner) object that will protect the object.\n\nto create a role object and a mntner object at the same time, go to the web application.\n\nfor more information about maintainers and hierarchical authorisation, please see [\'authorisation model\'].\n\nto find out how to create role and mntner objects, and to protect objects using your mntner, see the e-learning course.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# database business rules\n\nthe ripe database contains objects formatted according to the routing policy specification language (rpsl), which has a set of syntax rules you have to comply with when creating, updating or deleting objects. in addition, the

facilitate this, there is a dedicated object which is used to protect all other objects you manage: the maintainer. this page explains how to set up a maintainer for yourself and your organisation, as well as handling delegation of authorisation to other parties.\n\nthe maintainer (mntner) object is used to protect other objects in the ripe database. this is done by referring to the maintainer from the object you want to protect, using the "mnt-by:" attribute. the maintainer contains one or more authentication methods that you can use to authorise making changes to your objects.\n\n\n\nmaintainers are anonymous. other than the authentication references they contain, there is nothing that ties them to a specific person, group or organisation. authentication is handled as a "logical or", meaning that if you know one of several credentials associated with a maintainer, you can make changes to the objects that refer to it. in the example above, two people can use their ripe ncc access (single sing-on) account to make changes to the inet6num object, or the pgp key can be used. which authentication method is best for your use case is explained in a separate section: protecting your data in the ripe database.\n\nmost commonly, a maintainer object is maintained by itself, meaning that the "mnt-by:" attribute of the maintainer refers to the same object. if you want to edit details, for example add or remove an authentication, you simply need to use one of the existing authentication methods. in the example above, one of the three authentications can be used to add a forth, such as new colleague joining the team.\n\nwhat makes the maintainer system flexible is the fact that you have a lot of freedom in: * the number of maintainer objects you create * the number of maintainers you refer to from each ripe database object * the kind and number of authentication methods you use in each maintainer * delegation of authorisation to a specific person or group * controlling what kind of objects a certain group can create (such as route(6), domain and inet(6)num objects)\n\ngiven this flexibility, you must ensure you make the right choices when setting up authorisation. there are some important concepts and best practices to keep in mind which are explained in each of the following sections.\n\n\n# the default maintainer\n\nif you are an lir and you have received internet number resources, several objects are created by the ripe ncc in the ripe database to reflect this. these objects are managed by the ripe ncc, but you have control over some attributes, such as setting the administrative and technical contact person. in order to allow you to make these changes, an additional maintainer will be present on the object, the so-called "default" maintainer. you have to select this maintainer on the account details page and this will be reflected in the "mnt-by:" attribute on all existing and new objects that have joint responsibility: top level allocations for ip resources (inet(6)num and aut-num objects) and the organisation object. if you had a previous default maintainer the new default maintainer will replace your previous one.\n\nafter selecting the default maintainer, you can change all of the attributes you could previously modify by using the object editors - such as technical, administrative and abuse contact details - through the ripe database itself. you can use any update method you like, e.g. webupdates, syncupdates or email updates.\n\n\n# personal maintainers versus shared maintainers\n\nwhen you first use the ripe database, you need to create some basic objects. every object you create in the database must be maintained. that means you need a mntner object. this object must reference a role (or person) object as a contact. however, the role (or person) object must be maintained. therefore, a user cannot create either of these two objects first using any of the usual update methods. this means when you start using the ripe database, you first step would be to create a role and maintainer pair for yourself.\n\nmost other objects, especially the ones that are related to your resources, should be editable by you and your colleagues in the it department or network operations centre. for these objects you should be using a single maintainer that is shared by a group of people. in most cases, this maintainer was created when you registered as a ripe ncc member or became a resource holder in another way. if not, it is always possible to create a shared maintainer at a later point.\n\nkeep in mind that sharing a maintainer doesn\'t mean sharing the credentials as well, such as a password or a key. as explained earlier, a maintainer can contain multiple authentication attributes, so each person that has access to it can use their own set of credentials.\n\n\n# delegating authorisation using maintainers\n\nthe idea behind delegation of authorisation is that you can authorise a certain group (either within or outside your organisation) to create objects under a certain parent object that you control. for example, your can allow your colleagues who are responsible for the bgp routing configuration to create route(6) objects to register the announcement in the internet routing registry (irr), and nothing else. likewise, you can authorise your dns group to request reverse delegation by creating a domain object and nothing else.\n\nfor this purpose, three attributes exist:\n\n* "mnt-lower:", for hierarchical control over one level more specific objects\n* "mnt-routes:", for the creation of **route(6)** objects in the irr\n* "mnt-domains:", for requesting reverse delegation of dns by creating a **domain** object\n\n\nthe "mnt-lower:" attribute specifies an existing mntner object used for hierarchical authorisation. it controls creation of objects one level more specific in the hierarchy of an object type (this only applies to inetnum, inet6num, as-block, aut-num, route, route6, or domain objects).\n\nthe most common occurrence of the "mnt-lower:" attribute is in the ip address allocation(s) that you have received from the ripe ncc. for example, if you are an lir and you have an ipv6 allocation, it is represented in the ripe database as an inet6num object. because the allocation is managed by the ripe ncc, one of the "mnt-by:" attributes is set to ripe-ncc-hm-mnt and the other is set by you after choosing the default maintainer. these are some of the attributes you would see:\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        lir-org-ripe\nstatus:     allocated\nmnt-by:     ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:     lir-noc-mnt \n\n\nthe ripe-ncc-hm-mnt maintainer prevents you from making changes to some of the attributes that are part of the ripe ncc\'s registry management, such as the "netname:". your lir\'s default maintainer allows you to make changes to attributes you manage, such as the "admin-c:" and "tech-c:". in addition, it allows you to create assignments, as well as route(6) and domain objects under this parent block. however, if you wish to delegate the creation of child resource objects to a separate group, you can do so by creating an additional maintainer for them and specify it as "mnt-lower:":\n\ninet6num:   2001:db8::/32\norg:        lir-org-ripe\nstatus:     allocated\nmnt-by:     ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:     lir-noc-mnt\nmnt-lower:  lir-ipmgmt-mnt\n\n\nlikewise, you can delegate control over the creation of **route(6)**and domain objects by adding a "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attribute to the allocation. keep in mind that you first have to select a default maintainer before you can do this. the resulting allocation object would look something like this:\n\ninet6num:    2001:db8::/32\norg:         lir-org-ripe\nstatus:      allocated\nmnt-by:      ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\nmnt-by:      lir-noc-mnt\nmnt-lower:   lir-ipmgmt-mnt\nmnt-routes:  lir-rtrmgmt-mnt\nmnt-domains: lir-dnsmgmt-mnt\n\n\nafter you have done this, you can achieve fine-grained control over the creation of inet(6)num, route(6) and domain objects.\n\nin this example, route and domain objects are managed by separate maintainers: lir-rtrmgmt-mnt and lir-dnsmgmt-mnt respectively, as specified in the allocation. in addition, a "nt-lower:" was specified in the aggregate prefix for the broadband pool (2001:db8::/36). this allows for the creation of more specific objects below it by lir-broadband-mnt:\n\n\n\nin general, keep in mind that when as inet(6)num, route(6) or a domain object is created, authentication is required from the parent object. if the parent has a "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" or "mnt-domains:" attribute, this is the mntner that will need to be authenticated against. otherwise the parent "mnt-by:" attribute is used.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# highlighted values in the ripe database\n\nthis function highlights values in the ripe database that are maintained by the ripe ncc. these values are subject to an established due diligence process, which is described in the ripe ncc procedural document due diligence for the quality of the ripe ncc registration data.\n\n\n# non-highlighted values\n\nobjects in the ripe database are mostly created and updated by users. the ripe ncc makes every effort possible within its resources to keep the ripe database clean of false, obsolete and unnecessary data. however, the ripe ncc cannot guarantee the accuracy of all data in the ripe database.\n\ninaccurate values in the ripe database, whether highlighted or not, should be reported to the ripe ncc via the contact form.\n\n\n# data not published in the ripe database\n\nthe ripe ncc keeps a comprehensive record of all internet number resources registered within the ripe ncc service region to ensure that each resource holder holds unique and legitimate ip address space and asns.\n\nthe collective of these data is generally referred to as the "ripe registry". information in the ripe registry is subject to the specific and rigorous due diligence checks referred to above. as the ripe registry contains information that is subject to data protection laws and to confidentiality agreements between the ripe ncc and its membership, much of this information cannot be made publicly available. information from the ripe registry that appears in the ripe database is not restricted by confidentiality agreements.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# support

space\n * routing registry information\n * reverse dns delegations\n * related objects\n\nthe data is entered into the ripe database mainly by operators of ip networks within the ripe ncc service region. these are the maintainers of the data. the ripe ncc supports the operation of the ripe database. the maintainers are primarily responsible for the data but the ripe ncc also has some responsibility as a database controller. the responsibilities are explained in more detail in the ripe database terms and conditions.\n\nthe data is accessible by whois query (whois.ripe.net) and through a web interface, subject to the ripe database terms and conditions.\n\n\n# what is acceptable use of the ripe database?\n\nthe purpose and use of the ripe database is defined in the ripe database terms and conditions. the purpose of the ripe database is to assist the operation of the internet in the ripe region. use of information from the ripe database for activities such as marketing, advertising and distributing unsolicited commercial e-mail (uce) is covered by the terms and conditions.\n\n\n# what is a netname?\n\na netname is a mandatory attribute of an inetnum object which contains a short but meaningful name of the ip allocation or assignment. two or more inetnum objects can have the same netname. the netname attribute is a look-up key, one can query the ripe database supplying the netname as an argument. the result of the query will show all inetnum objects with that netname.\n\n\n# what is a nic-hdl?\n\na "nic-handle" is a unique identifier that references ripe database objects containing contact details for a specific person or role. other ripe database objects list contact details by their nic-handle. this is a more reliable identifier than an email address or a person\'s name (which may not be unique).\n\n\n# can i use a nic-handle from another regional internet registry database in the ripe database?\n\nyes, but you must create a person/role object in the ripe database to ensure referential integrity. there is no existing distributed database of person/role objects (i.e. contact information). please note that updating an object in one database does not mean the object will be updated in any other database.\n\n\n# what is a tech-c and what is an admin-c?\n\nan "admin-c" (administrative contact) and "tech-c" (technical contact) are network contacts, required to be listed by their nic-handles in certain ripe database objects. this is done for operational correspondence such as network troubleshooting. the admin-c must be physically located at the site of the network. the tech-c does not need to be physically located at the site of the network. you can have multiple admin-c, tech-c and zone-c attributes in an object, each of them referencing different person or role objects.\n\n\n# why has my \'as-name:\' not been accepted?\n\nthe \'as-name:\' should be a short name associated with the autonomous system (as). we recommend that the name reflects the name of the organisation that will use the as number. the name should be made up of letters, digits, the character underscore "_", and the character hyphen "-"; the first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. the following words are reserved by rpsl, and they can not be used as names: any, as-any, rs-any, peers, and, or, not, atomic, from, to, at, action, accept, announce, except, refine, networks, into, inbound, outbound\n\nnames starting with certain prefixes are reserved for certain object types. names starting with "as-" are reserved for as set names. names starting with "rs-" are reserved for route set names. names starting with "rtrs-" are reserved for router set names. names starting with "fltr-" are reserved for filter set names. names starting with "prng-" are reserved for peering set names. names starting with "irt-" are reserved for irt names.\n\n\n# can i register a domain name in the ripe database?\n\nno, the ripe ncc does not register domain names. a decision was made by the ripe community to remove all forward domain names from the ripe database.\n\n\n# how do i register a person or role object in the ripe database?\n\nnew ripe database users should create a role and maintainer pair. if you already have a maintainer object, you can use webupdates to create a additional objects.\n\nplease note that person objects registered in the ripe database should be referenced from other objects in the ripe database, either directly or through a role object. unreferenced objects will be deleted after 90 days.\n\n\n# someone has created a person object with my personal details in the ripe database. why did they do this?\n\nsome internet service providers (isps) put information about their customers in the ripe database. this is usually because you have signed an agreement with the isp to obtain internet services from them and given your consent to publish your personal details in the ripe database. if you are unhappy with this, please contact your isp. if you cannot resolve this issue with your isp, please contact the ripe ncc.\n\n\n# my information in the ripe database is not correct, can you please update my object(s)?\n\nthe ripe database terms and conditions detail who is responsible for maintaining data in the ripe database. we suggest you contact the maintainer of the data that is incorrect and ask them to change it. if it is personal data that is incorrect and you are not satisfied with the response from the maintainer, please contact the ripe ncc.\n\n\n# how do i delete an object from the ripe database?\n\nif you query for your object in the ripe database web interface, you will see the option to update it in the top right corner.\n\nafter logging in with your ripe ncc access account, you may be required to authenticate against the maintainer that protects the object if it is not yet associated with your account.\n\nyou will then get to the screen where you can modify the object. the "delete" button is in the bottom left corner.\n\nafter selecting "delete this object", you will be asked for an optional reason. once you provide this, the object will be removed from the ripe database.\n\n\n# my update failed. please explain why it failed.\n\nthere are many reasons why an update could fail. usually, the failure reasons listed in the acknowledgement message you received are self-explanatory. the errors and warnings are contained in the "***error:" and "***warning:" lines attached to the object which failed. please read these lines carefully. often the errors are simple syntax errors in the object. check your object for typing mistakes.\n\nanother common mistake is to query the ripe database for an object without using the -b query flag, then submit the returned object in an update. this results in submitting a filtered object, indicated by the line \'source: ripe # filtered\' in the query response.\n\nsometimes, your update fails with this error message: "***error: authorisation failed". this means that you haven\'t supplied the correct credentials to satisfy the authorisation needed for the maintainer that protects the object. the maintainer is notified of a failed attempt to update this object.\n\nplease note that if you send several objects in one message and at least one of them fails, the subject of the acknowledgment message will start with "failed:". this does not mean that the whole update failed, only that some updates were unsuccessful. please check the message carefully to see which objects were not updated.\n\n\n# i received a message with the subject "notification of ripe database changes", but i didn\'t do anything and don\'t understand the message. what is it?\n\nthe message you received has been automatically sent to you from the ripe database software. the purpose of this notification is to inform you that some objects have been changed in the ripe database. you received the message because you were either listed in a "notify:" attribute of the object itself, or in a "mnt-nfy:" attribute of the mntner that protects the object.\n\nif you did not create or update the object yourself, then someone else did this. the e-mail address from which the update came is usually mentioned in the notification message. please contact that e-mail address for questions and clarifications about the update.\n\n\n# what are the authorisation rules for route object creation?\n\nrefer to protection of route object space.\n\n\n# can i download the ripe database software?\n\nyes you can download the ripe database whois server software from github.\n\n\n# can i download the ripe database?\n\nwe produce daily snapshots which are available to the public. you can find these files at our ftp site or split by object type.\n\nthese daily snapshots exclude the person object type and other personal data is dummified. for data protection reasons, personal data is not available in bulk format.\n\nanother way to "download" the ripe database is to become a near-real-time mirror (nrtm). this means that you run a copy of the database at your site that keeps up-to-date with the master server by regularly downloading the most recent updates. all personal data is excluded from the nrtm download and updates. for more information, refer to access to nrtm.\n\n\n# i cannot find any information about a network in the ripe database. can i look somewhere else?\n\nyes: try full text search.\n\n\n# how do i register reverse-delegations in the ripe database?\n\nto register reverse-delegations in the ripe database, see reverse delegations.\n\n\n# i want to have an ip to country conversion table; can i get it?\n\nthe inetnum object represents ip address space in the ripe database; this object has a \'country\' attribute. however, you should not rely on this information to be 100% accurate.\n\nresource holders can also add a "geofeed:" attribute to associate ip addresses to geographic locales. refer to rfc9092 for more information.\n\n\n# i want to peer with an autonomous system (as). how do i do this?\n\nonce an as number has been assigned to you, you are responsible for keeping it up to date. it is important that your aut-num object in the ripe database reflects reality. if you have new peers and/or stop peering with one or more autonomous systems, please update your aut-num object. you update this object in the same way as any other object in the ripe database.\n\n\n# can i enter several contacts in one ripe database object?\n\nyes. you can have multiple admin-c, tech-c and zone-c attributes in an object, each of them referencing different contact record, person or role objects.\n\n\n# how do i update an object in the ripe database?\n\nif you query for your object in the ripe database web interface, you will see the option to update it in the top right corner.\n\nafter logging in with your ripe ncc access account, you may be required to authenticate against the maintainer that protects the object if it is not yet associated with your account. you will then get to the screen where you can modify the object.\n\n\n# where are the rir databases, and what do they contain?\n\nthere are five regional internet registries (rirs). each maintains a database holding details of ip address registrations in their regions. the rir databases are located at:\n\nafrinic (africa) arin (north america, some caribbean and north atlantic islands) apnic (asia pacific region) lacnic (southern and central america and some caribbean islands) ripe ncc (europe, the middle east, parts of central asia)\n\n\n# why did i receive an error 201: access denied?\n\nthere are several cases when this might occur. please see below for the one which applies to your situation:\n\n * you (or your application) performed too many queries that returned contact information (e.g. person or role objects) from the ripe database. there is a daily limit on the amount of personal data returned as described in the acceptable use policy.\n * even if you queried for other types of objects, the associated contact information is returned by default. to avoid this situation please use the -r flag to prevent any associated contact information from being returned.\n * you used a proxy server to access the ripe database (such as a third-party web query interface). in this case, it is likely that the proxy itself was denied access to the database. please contact then administrators of the server you were using and discuss this situation with them. they may need to contact the ripe database administration ripe-dbm@ripe.net team to request further access.\n * if none of the above describes your situation, please contact the ripe database administration team ripe-dbm@ripe.net to discuss the problem further.\n\n\n# how do i generate glue record for a domain object?\n\nhere is an example:\n\ndomain: 8.8.8.e164.arpa\ndescr: example domain for the reserved prefix +888\n[...]\nnserver: ns1.8.8.8.e164.arpa 192.0.2.1\nnserver: ns2.8.8.8.e164.arpa 192.0.2.129\nnserver: ns1.example.net\nnserver: ns2.example.net\n[...]\n\n\nin this example, the first two "nserver:" attributes contain one glue ip address. the last two "nserver:" attributes do not need glue, as they are in a different domain - example.net.\n\n\n# how will i know what to fix if the domain object update failed?\n\nthe responses from our server will include diagnostic messages. you can get further help by sending an email to ripe-dbm@ripe.net.\n\n\n# how long until an update appears in the dns?\n\nif you see a message saying that your update was successful, it will be visible in the dns after around an hour.\n\n\n# which ttl value is used?\n\nwe will use the default value for the e164.arpa zone. if you need a specific ttl (time to live) value, send an email to enum-request@ripe.net.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# glossary\n\n\n# attribute continuation line\n\nwhen an attribute value uses more than one line, the extra lines are

management of the object(s) in the update message. for example supplying a password for an update using the "password:" pseudo attribute.\n\n\n# query the ripe database\n\nto request information from the ripe database\n\n\n# range notation\n\nspecifies ranges using two parts: the starting address and the end address separated by a hyphen and space characters (\'-\')\n\n\n# registrant\n\na natural person or legal entity to whom an internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other primary object in the ripe database by specific or general agreement with the ripe

holder\n\na person or organisation to which an internet resource has been registered.\n\n\n# reverse delegation\n\nallows mapping to a domain name from an ip address.\n\n\n# ripe community\n\nripe (reseaux ip europeens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide are ip networks in europe and beyond. the objective of ripe is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-european ip network.\n\n\n# ripe database\n\nthe publicly available data collection of internet number registry (inr) data, internet routing registry (irr) data and reverse delegation data published by the ripe ncc. it contains all the primary and secondary objects. there is also some non-public data required for the operation of the ripe database and the registries. its full title is the ripe network management database. or sometime it is referred to as the ripe whois database. but for simplicity it is mostly referred to as the ripe database. these names are interchangeable and all mean the same thing.\n\n\n# ripe database attribute\n\nthe key name for a formatted element of data in a ripe database object. the format may be well defined or free format. an attribute must always have a value associated with it. unless it is free format, the value cannot be blank. attributes are sometimes referred to as keys.\n\n\n# ripe database object\n\na record in the ripe database containing information about an internet resource or some supporting or administrative details.\n\n\n# ripe internet number registry (ripe inr)\n\na registry managed by the ripe ncc that allocated internet number resources and holds and publishes details of ripe resources.\n\n\n# ripe internet routing registry (ripe irr)\n\na registry managed by

(irr) is used for purposes that have a strong requirements for data integrity and security. the routing policy system security addresses issues of data integrity and security consistent with the usage of the irr and which avoids compromising data integrity and security.\n\n\n# secondary objects\n\na set of objects that exist in the ripe database to support the primary objects.\n\n\n# uniform resource identifier (uri)\n\nthe generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the world wide web. a url (uniform resource locator or web address) is one kind of uri.\n\n\n# update the ripe database\n\nsubmit information for entry into or removal from the ripe database.\n\n\n# utf8\n\na character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters.\n\n\n# whois database\n\nan interchangeable phrase sometimes used to describe the ripe database. it can also be used to describe other types of databases like domain name registries.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# how to query the ripe database\n\nquerying the ripe database is the process of reading information from the database. historically, this was done from the command line using a whois client. now, there are a number of ways to query the ripe database.\n\nwe describe the general format of a query and the query flags that you can use to change the default behaviour of a query.\n\nwe also describe how the database server automatically tracks query responses and limits how much contact information you can take from the ripe database. we do this to reduce the chance that someone will use the database to send spam e-mails to addresses that they find.\n\nfollowing acceptable use policy, we strive to detect potential attacks. if a dos attack is detected, we temporarily block the user\'s ip address.\n\nthe ripe database terms and conditions allow the ripe ncc to block or suspend access to the ripe database services for any suspected abuse. users exhibiting suspected abusive behavior may be permanently blocked from the system. if a user is permanently blocked, they will receive a notification informing them of the block whenever they attempt to make a query.\n\nif you wish to be unblocked, please contact the ripe database administration team ripe-dbm@ripe.net to discuss further.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# command line queries\n\nqueries can be run from almost any computer (connected to the internet) using standard features built into most operating systems. some common methods include netcat, telnet and a whois client.\n\n\n# netcat\n\nnetcat is a computer networking service for reading from and writing to network connections, using tcp or udp. netcat can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. netcat can often be abbreviated to the command ‘nc\'. this is an example query using netcat.\n\n$ nc

server for all query methods.\n * output lines starting with the % sign are either a server response code or server messages (a comment, information message or an error with description).\n * a message contains a white space after the % sign, while a server response code starts right after the % sign. see appendix c, ripe database query server response codes and messages for more information.\n * do not write scripts to parse the messages. the text is subject to change at any time.\n * an empty line terminates a database object in the output. this is a line containing only a newline character (\\n).\n * two empty lines, each containing only a new-line character (\\n), mean the end of a server response.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# registration data access protocol (rdap)\n\nthe registration data access protocol (rdap) is an alternative protocol to whois that specifies how to access internet resource registration data. it is specifically designed to address various shortcomings in whois. it makes use of https and follows a restful (representational state transfer) web services model.\n\n\n# using rdap to query the ripe database\n\nthe contents of ripe database can be accessed using rdap via https://rdap.db.ripe.net/{objecttype}/{key} where {objecttype} must be one of the object types listed below, and the value of {key} depends on the object type.\n\nlist of supported object types\n\nobject type   description\nautnum        aut-num objects. example:\n              https://rdap.db.ripe.net/autnum/3333\ndomain        domain objects.

        https://rdap.db.ripe.net/ip/2001:67c:2e8::/48\nentity        person, role, organisation and mntner objects. example:\n              https://rdap.db.ripe.net/entity/ripe-ncc-mnt\n\nfor example, a query for ip information:\n\ncurl -v https://rdap.db.ripe.net/ip/2001:67c:2e8:9::c100:14e6\n\n\nand an example query for domain information:\n\ncurl -v https://rdap.db.ripe.net/domain/193.0.6.139.in-addr.arpa\n\n\nif the ripe database is not authoritative for the requested resource, the response will redirect to the authoritative rir with a http 301 response status.\n\n\n# entity search\n\nthe entities path segment allows searching for matching entities based on a term. the output is an array with objects in rdap format.\n\nsyntax:\n\nhttps://rdap.db.ripe.net/entities?fn={fn}&handle={handle}\n\n\nwhere:\n\n * fn: returns all the matches for person:, role:, and org-name: attributes.\n   * example: https://rdap.db.ripe.net/entities?fn=ripe-ripe\n * handle: returns all the matches for organisation:, nic-hdl: and mntner:(maintainer) attributes.\n   * example: https://rdap.db.ripe.net/entities?handle=ripe-ripe\n\n\n# domain search\n\nthe domains path segment allows searching for matches based on a term. the output is an array with objects in rdap format.\n\nsyntax:\n\nhttps://rdap.db.ripe.net/domains?name={name}\n\n\nwhere:\n\n * name: returns all the matches for the domain: attribute\n   * example: https://rdap.db.ripe.net/domains?name=196.46.95.in-addr.arpa\n\n\n# help\n\nthe help path segment return a valid rdap object containing the default set of notices for the service. the rdapconformance element in the response include the extension identifiers for all the extensions implemented.\n\nsyntax:\n\nhttps://rdap.db.ripe.net/help\n\n\n\n# rdap specification\n\nthe rdap protocol is specified in the following rfcs:\n\n * rfc 7480 – http usage in the registration data access protocol (rdap)\n * rfc 7481 – security services for the registration data access protocol (rdap)\n * rfc 9082 – registration data access protocol (rdap) query format\n * rfc 9083 – json responses for the registration data access protocol (rdap)\n * rfc 7484 – finding the authoritative registration data (rdap) service\n * rfc 7485 – inventory and analysis of whois registration objects\n\n\n# rdap profiles\n\nin addition to the base rdap specification, we also implement the following profiles:\n\n * nro rdap profile.\n * nro rdap cidr.\n * redacted.\n * rir search\n\n\n# known issues\n\nknown issues with the rdap implementation for ripe database can be found on github.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# restful api queries\n\nqueries are supported by the restful api using the get method. there are two ways of using the api. one way looks up a specific object and only returns a single object. the other searches for objects matching specified criteria. the search may return large numbers of objects.\n\nthe possible values that you can specify for the accept/content-type header are:\n\n * application/xml for xml\n * application/json for json\n * text/plain for text\n\nclients can also append an extension of ".xml", ".json" or ".txt" to the request url path instead of setting an accept: header. the server will return a response in the appropriate format for that given extension. xml format is the default one.\n\n\n# rest api lookup\n\nthis can be done from the command line using a third party software package, from a script or in a browser. it will only return the one specific object requested. for lookups on address space, it will not return the encompassing object if the specified object does not exist. by default objects are filtered as described in filtering the query response.\n\nreturns an object from the ripe database.\n\ncurl \'https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/inetnum/193.0.0.0%20-%20193.0.7.255?unfiltered\'\n\n\nany spaces in the command must be encoded. the response will be returned by default in xml format. alternatively json or text/plain can be returned:\n\ncurl -h \'accept: application/json\'\n\n\nadditional resources:\n\n * version list\n * version

you are using the web application you can automatically be authenticated in one mntner if that mntner is associated to your sso account.\n * client certificate: you can supply your own certificate, and it is checked against the queried object\'s mntner key-certs\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# the structure of a query\n\nthe general format of a query is:\n\n[optional query flag [optional query flag argument]] <query argument> \n\n\nthe query flags may be before or after the query argument.\n\nmany query flags have a short and long format. the short format is:\n\n-short_query_flag [optional query flag argument]\n\nfor example,  -b dw-ripe\n\n\nthe long format is:\n\n--long_query_flag [optional query flag argument]\n\nfor example, --no-filtering dw-ripe\n\n\nwhen a query includes many query flags, the short and long format options may be mixed. you may list each query flag separately, for example:\n\n-b –i tech-c --no-grouping dw-ripe\n\n\nyou can also group short query flags together. the long query flags must always be separated. when short flags are grouped, only the last flag in a group may have a flag argument, as in:\n\n-bi tech-c --no-grouping dw-ripe\n\n\nthe query argument is not case-sensitive. as shown in the examples above, it can be in upper case, lower case or a mixed case. query flags are case-sensitive. this applies to both short- and long-format flags. however, the arguments to the query flags are not case-sensitive. there can be an optional space between a query flag and its argument. however, if the query flag argument is a list, there can be no spaces between elements of the list.\n\n-rbg –tinetnum,inet6num –imb ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\n\n-rbg –t inetnum,inet6num –i mb ripe-ncc-hm-mnt\n\n\na list of query flags and query flag arguments are available.\n\nif you type an ip range you will get an exact match ip range if it exists. otherwise smallest ip range containing it. (inetnum/inet6num and route/route6 objects).\n\nif you type a single ip address you will get the smallest ip range containing this ip address. (inetnum/inet6num and route/route6 objects).\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# web query form\n\nthe web query form is available at: https://apps.db.ripe.net/.\n\nthis is part of the ripe database web interface that also includes webupdates.\n\nthe query argument is entered into the form. many of the query flags can be selected with check boxes. the database source can also be selected this way. if you know the query flags you want, you can also type them into the form with the query argument.\n\n\n# using full text search\n\nif you are looking for a specific piece of information and you don\'t know one of the values required to find what you are looking for, you may consider using the full text search instead of doing a standard query. full text search treats the entire database as a flat text file and allows you to search for anything. the search is done on object text without regard for any relationships. as such, results may be very unstructured, but it can provide a good starting point for more specific standard queries later on. keep in mind that full text search is only available on the ripe ncc website and not in other methods to query the ripe database.\n\npersonal data may be returned by the full text search api. you may be blocked if excessive amounts of personal data is returned. for more information refer to blocking access section\n\n\n# uri format: /fulltextsearch/select?...\n\n\n# query parameters\n\nname             default   description\nq                          this parameter is used to specify the query for

conditions (hereinafter: the ‘terms and conditions’). the terms and conditions shall apply to anyone who accesses and uses the ripe database.\n\n\n# introduction\n\nthe ripe ncc is authorised by the ripe community to act as the registration authority for internet number resources in its service region and to manage the operation of the ripe database.\n\n\n# article 1 - definitions\n\nin the terms and conditions, the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nripe ncc - reseaux ip europeens network coordination centre. a membership association under dutch law operating its registered office in amsterdam, the netherlands.\n\nripe community - ripe (reseaux ip europeens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide area ip networks in europe and beyond. the objective of ripe is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-european ip network.\n\nupdate - submitting information for entry into or removal from the ripe database\n\nquery - requesting information from the ripe database\n\naccess - update and query the ripe database\n\ninternet number resources - globally unique address space (ipv4 and ipv6) and autonomous system numbers (asns) issued by any internet number registry.\n\nprimary objects - internet number resources and other data object types that are not directly related to any other primary object type and which are defined by routing policy specification language (rpsl) or which have been agreed by the ripe community as acceptable primary data.\n\nsecondary objects - objects that are defined by rpsl or which have been agreed by the ripe community as acceptable secondary data and which are related, either directly or indirectly, to primary objects.\n\nripe database - the publicly available data collection of internet number registry (inr) and internet routing registry (irr) data published by the ripe ncc. it contains all the primary and secondary objects. there is also some non-public data required for the operation of the ripe database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the ripe database.\n\nregistrant - a natural person or legal entity to whom an internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other primary object in the ripe database by specific or general agreement with the ripe ncc.\n\nmaintainer - any registrant or person to whom the authority to update has been delegated by a registrant either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\nuser - anyone who accesses the ripe database. this includes registrants and maintainers.\n\nrpsl - routing policy specification language\n\ninternet number registry (inr) - a registry that allocates internet number resources and holds and publishes details of internet number resource information.\n\ninternet routing registry (irr) - a registry that holds and publishes details of internet routing information.\n\ncontact details - all details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, e-mail or any other form of electronic communication that is used by a natural person or a legal entity.\n\n\n# article 2 - general\n\n 1. access to the ripe database is available to anyone provided these terms and conditions are followed.\n 2. a user may only access the ripe database and the data contained therein to the extent permitted by these terms and conditions. a user who accesses the ripe database agrees to these terms and conditions.\n 3. only registrants and the ripe ncc have the authority to update the ripe database. to update the ripe database, a registrant has to take on the role of a maintainer or authorise a third party to act as maintainer on his behalf.\n 4. a registrant who accepts a registration of an internet number resource from the ripe ncc, or who registers any other primary object in the ripe database, or who copies a registration of an internet number resource from another registry into the ripe database, must accept these terms and conditions before assuming a registrant\'s authority to update the ripe database, even if that authority is then delegated to a maintainer.\n 5. a maintainer who is not a registrant must accept these terms and conditions before accepting the delegated authority from a registrant to update the ripe database.\n 6. a maintainer may only update the ripe database with these types of data:\n    * internet number resources for which the registrant holds a valid registration\n    * primary objects that are not internet number resources, for which the registrant has agreement to register\n    * secondary objects related to either of the above\n 7. a secondary object must be related to an existing or intended valid primary object at the time of the update to create the secondary object in the ripe database. at any time this relationship becomes no longer valid, or the intended relation is never completed, the secondary object must be deleted. it may be subject to automatic deletion by the ripe database management software at any time if it is invalid.\n 8. registrants and maintainers will assist the ripe ncc with security checks and audits as appropriate.\n\n\n# article 3 - purpose of the ripe database\n\nthe ripe database contains information for the following purposes:\n\n * ensuring the uniqueness of internet number resource usage through registration of information related to the resources and registrants\n * publishing routing policies by network operators (irr)\n * facilitating coordination between network operators (network problem resolution, outage notification etc.)\n * facilitating network operations by publishing geolocation information about the usage of internet number resources (including country, region, city of the party to which the resources have been distributed by the registrants)\n * provisioning of reverse domain name system (dns) and enum delegations\n * providing information about the registrant and maintainer of internet number resources when the resources are suspected of being used for unlawful activities, to parties who are authorised under the law to receive such information.\n * scientific research into network operations and topology\n * providing information to parties involved in disputes over internet number resource registrations to parties who are authorised under the law to receive such information.\n\n\n# article 4 - use of the ripe database\n\n 1. a user may only access the ripe database and the data contained therein for any of the purposes as mentioned in article 3 hereof and provided these terms and conditions are followed.

permitted by the acceptable use policy.\n 3. the ripe ncc records details about all queries and updates for purposes including detecting and preventing unacceptable use.\n 4. a user may not use the ripe database or the data contained therein for advertising, direct marketing, marketing research or similar purposes.\n 5. a user may not re-package, download, compile, re-distribute or re-use any or all of the ripe database or the data contained therein unless they do so only with an insubstantial part of the ripe database or the data contained therein or when permission to do so is granted by the ripe ncc.\n 6. a maintainer can authenticate updates by using a personal or organisation\'s identifier of a type supported by the ripe database authentication scheme.\n 7. the ripe ncc will assume that any action done, or asked for, using that identifier was carried out, or asked for, by the maintainer who holds that identifier.\n 8. the ripe ncc may at its sole discretion implement procedures for dealing with lost, cancelled or insecure identifiers.\n\n\n# article 5 - control of the ripe database\n\n 1. the ripe ncc may correct or delete ripe database data:\n    * according to ripe policies\n    * to comply with applicable law\n    * if so ordered by any competent court\n    * to fulfill any legal obligation\n    * when a breach of the terms and conditions has occurred\n    * for management operations of the ripe database\n    * if any data is inaccurate\n    * if any data is entered by someone who is not authorised to do so\n 2. the ripe ncc may withdraw the service provided hereunder from a user at any time and is entitled, in its sole discretion, to terminate or slow down a user\'s access to the ripe database for any reason, particularly a failure to adhere to the terms and conditions.\n 3. the ripe ncc may suspend access to the ripe database, or part thereof, for maintenance purposes, upgrades, security fixes and deployment of new services subject to notification of the ripe community.\n 4. the ripe ncc may, in accordance with the removal of personal data procedure, remove the personal data of an individual upon request by this individual. the ripe ncc will only take such action when convinced that a valid request from the right person is received.\n\n\n# article 6 - responsibilities\n\n 1. the ripe ncc does not guarantee the accuracy, or completeness or availability of the ripe database or of the data contained therein.\n 2. the maintainer is responsible for keeping all data maintained by them accurate and up-to-date, including correct contact details. the data must be good enough to allow the ripe ncc to contact the maintainer or registrant within a reasonable time without having to get information from another source.\n 3. the maintainer who enters personal data into the ripe database has a responsibility to inform the individual to whom the data pertains and to obtain their explicit consent for the entry in the public ripe database if required by law.\n 4. the ripe ncc is not responsible for the use and any issues arising from the use of any registered internet number resources.\n\n\n# article 7 - liability\n\n 1. use of the ripe database and the data contained therein is at the user\'s own risk.\n 2. with the exception of any wilful damage or gross negligence committed by the ripe ncc or its managerial staff, neither the ripe ncc nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives who make the ripe database available or provide any other service whatsoever to the user, shall be liable to the user or to any third party, including any governmental agency, for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses whatsoever relating directly or indirectly to the use of the ripe database, and the user agrees to hold harmless, indemnify and defend the ripe ncc, its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives for any such claims, losses, damages, liabilities or expenses, and all costs and expenses that may be incurred in relation to their use of the ripe database, including reasonable attorneys\' fees.\n 3. all rights of legal action and other entitlements on the part of the user towards the ripe ncc in connection with the (use of) the ripe database shall lapse as soon as a one year term has expired since the date on which the user has

different types of tests\n\n * unit tests: mvn clean install\n * integration tests: mvn clean install -pintegration\n * unit + integration tests: mvn clean install -pall\n * functional tests: mvn clean install -pendtoend\n\n\n# release\n\nto make a release: mvn clean install -prelease\n\nto perform a release: mvn clean release:prepare release:perform -prelease\n\nperforming a release updates version in pom.xml, commits+pushes to git, tried to push artifacts to repo, etc..., whereas making a release will simply make a shaded jar using the current version in pom.xml, nothing else.\n\nthe release jar will be created in whois-db/target/whois-db-<pom-xml-version>.jar\n\n\n# configuring your ide\n\n * install intellij idea http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/\n * import project\n * point to local whois git repository\n * import using maven pom\n\nif there are compilation errors, make sure to perform a maven build first, since it will generate required sources:\n\nmvn clean install\n\n\n\n# running whois from within intellij\n\n * ensure mariadb and the needed databases are created and populated\n   \n   * see getting started on macos for installation information.\n   * see configure mariadb for instructions how to create and grant user permission.\n   * see installation instructions for instructions on how to create and populate needed databases.\n\n * ensure whois/tools directory is populated with hazelcast.xml file.\n\n * ensure a local property is available in tools directory. copy whois/whois-commons/src/test/resources/whois.properties and whois/whois-commons/src/test/resources/log4j2.xml into whois/tools directory and ensure the following properties are updated to allow running locally, for example have the following:\n   \n   port.query=1043 port.api=1080 port.nrtm=1081\n\nalso ensure database username and password matches what you have locally. (normally this should be dbint with no password)\n\n * in run/debug configuration set vm options to:\n   \n   -dwhois.config=./tools/whois-local.properties -dhazelcast.config=./tools/hazelcast.xml -dlog4j.configurationfile=file:./tools/log4j2.xml\n\n * run mvn clean install -prelease to ensure property variables set in whois.version.properties is available.\n\n * start whois by running the main class net.ripe.db.whois.db.whoisserver\n\n\n# importing multiple maven sub-projects under one project\n\nunlike other ides, in intellij you can have only one project. however, you can import multiple projects as modules. if you want to import the whois project with its modules and also another maven project, e.g. whois-related follow the steps:\n\n * from the terminal use mvn clean install to build both projects.\n * create a new java project (e.g. root-project) in intellij using the suggested options from the wizard.\n * select import module, and navigate to whois project pom.\n * check the option to import recursively maven projects.\n * select root-project from the project explorer and repeat step 3 and 4 to import the whois-related project.\n\n\n# upgrading intellij\n\nif you upgrade to a newer version of intellij, it will ask you to upgrade your old projects as well.\n\nif there are problems in the project just remove the intellij files and re-import the projects:\n\n * quit intellij\n * go to the projects folder\n * delete .idea folders and *.iml files\n * re-import the projects as described above.\n\nif you want to delete all your intellij project files you can use the following commands:\n\nfind . -iname \'*.iml\' -print0 | xargs -0 rm\nfind . -type d -name \'.idea\' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf\n\n\n\n# suggested intellij ide preferences\n\n * appearance -> show tool window bars [on]\n * preferences -> build, execution, deployment -> compiler -> compile independent modules in parallel [off] (to prevent "internal aspectj compiler error")\n * editor -> general -> strip spaces on save (all)\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# coding standard\n\nin general, we follow the standard java coding standard: code conventions for the java programming language, with the following additions.\n\n\n# code format\n\n * use modern ide (import organisation, variable expansion, code generation features are essential). intellij is recommended.\n * wrap long lines where it makes sense. disable automatic line wrapping in ide; break it where you think it improves readability.\n * don\'t include unnecessary comments, code should be self-documenting. remember: comments have to be maintained too, but they are not covered by tests.\n * use readable variable names, which are descriptive of the purpose. rely on variable name completion of your ide.\n * don\'t embed tab characters, expand tabs to 4 spaces. no extra/trailing whitespace.\n * when in doubt, look at existing code & follow conventions.\n * use explicit imports, not .*\n\n\n# java conventions\n\n * use the final keyword on variables, so they cannot change unexpectedly (no side-effects).\n * use static imports when it makes sense. e.g. do not use them when there are more than one libraries providing the methods you are importing.\n\n\n# commits\n\n * you spend hours, days before making a commit. do spend that 30 seconds to break it into meaningful parts (e.g. using git gui).\n * commit cosmetic changes separately (e.g. as \'reformatted code\') to make code review easier.\n * add good explanation as a commit message. focus on why, not the how.\n * add warnings where you find necessary (e.g. \'will have to apply sql patch before deployment\').\n\n\n# file naming conventions\n\n * unit test classes are named <component>test.java, located under src/test/java.\n * java integration test classes are named <functionality>testintegration.java, also under src/test/java.\n * groovy integration tests are named <functionality>spec.groovy, under src/test/groovy.\n\n\n# testing\n\n * use hamcrest assertions (ie assertthat(..., is(..)) instead of assertequals(..,..))\n\n\n# intellij editor settings\n\n * settings / code style / java / wrapping / field annotations = \'do not wrap\'\n * settings / code style / java / imports / class count = 999, names count = 999\n\n\n# git\n\n * please use "git pull --rebase" to merge remote changes.\n * git config --global pull.rebase true\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# configure mariadb\n\ninstalling a mariadb server is useful for development, or for running your own whois server.\n\n\n# configuration\n\nset the following variables in the mariadb configuration (location varies depending on installation, the configuration file is normally called my.cnf).\n\n\n# development machine\n\nif mariadb was installed through brew on an apple silicon machine, new configuration files can be added under /opt/homebrew/etc/my.cnf.d/.\n\nadd the following configuration (e.g. in ripedb.cnf):\n\n[server]\ndefault-time-zone=+00:00\ninnodb_file_per_table = off\nmax_connections=1000\n\n\n\n# running your own whois server\n\nif you wish to run your own whois server, you need additional variables to be modified:\n\n * max_allowed_packet = 20m\n   \n   * we need big packet sizes as some objects are very big\n   * default is 1m\n   * ref. https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/server-system-variables/#max_allowed_packet\n\n * innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2g\n   \n   * as we only have innodb databases, this should be set to use all the remaining memory available\n   * leave some memory for the os, and the whois java process, and check for swap activity\n   * default is 128mb\n   * ref. https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/xtradbinnodb-server-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size\n\nrestart mariadb once all configuration changes have been made.\n\n\n# configure access to the database\n\n * check if mariadb is running mysqladmin -u root -p ping\n * login to mariadb using mysql -u root -p (or mysql with the default setup)\n * create users:\n\ncreate user \'dbint\'@\'localhost\' identified by \'\';\ngrant all privileges on *.* to \'dbint\'@\'localhost\';\n\ncreate user \'rdonly\'@\'localhost\' identified by \'\';\ngrant select privileges on *.* to

binaries.\n\n\n# java\n\n\n# installation\n\ninstall openjdk 17 or higher.\n\n# using brew\n\n * run brew install openjdk\n\n# manually\n\n * download and manually install openjdk from https://adoptium.net/\n\nmake sure after installation that running java -version reports the correct java version.\n\n\n# multiple java versions\n\nif you have multiple java versions installed, ensure that you have $java_home set, and that the $path contains $java_home/bin.\n\n\n# maven\n\nmaven can be installed through brew: run brew install maven\n\n\n# git\n\ngit can be installed via apple\'s xcode command line tools or brew.\n\nif brew is installed, git should already be installed, as it requires apple\'s xcode command line tools.\n\n\n# git bash completion (optional)\n\nbash can complete git commands, but it needs additional setup.\n\n# using brew\n\nthe git formulae ships git\'s bash completion:\n\n * run brew install git\n\nbash-completion is required for bash completion to work. depending on which bash is used, a different formulae must be installed:\n\n * for homebrew\'s bash (>= v4): run brew install bash-completion@2\n * for macos\'s bash (v3.2.57): run brew install bash-completion\n\nread the formulae\'s caveats for instructions on how to activate bash-completion by adding a line in your .bash_profile.\n\n\n# mariadb\n\n\n# installation\n\nthe easiest way of installing mariadb is through brew: run brew install mariadb\n\n\n# configuration\n\nconfigure mariadb\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# getting started on ubuntu linux\n\n\n# install packages\n\nas root, install a set of packages already available in the ubuntu linux repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get install git maven oracle-java8-jdk mariadb-client-5.5 mariadb-server-5.5\n\n\n# configure mariadb\n\nconfigure mariadb\n\n\n# system\n\nif at one point you see an error from mariadb like \'too many open files\' then update /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nsysctl -w kern.maxfiles=1048600\nsysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=1048576\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# installation instructions\n\nin this section we show how to make a standard setup of whois.\n\n\n# prerequisite\n\nensure mariadb and the needed databases are created and populated\n\n * see getting started on macos for installation information.\n * see configure mariadb for instructions how to create and grant user permission.\n\n\n# requirements\n\n * a server with 8gb ram, 8gb swap, and 120gb disk space is recommended to run whois.\n * create a role user to run whois server (by default, dbase)\n * whois root directory, owned by role user\n * mariadb configured\n * jmxterm-1.0.4-uber.jar, downloadable from the github project linked on http://wiki.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm.\n   * for jdk 17, jmxterm has a problem. as a workaround you can add --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=all-unnamed to java for jmxterm to make use of the jconsole module.\n * pgrep\n * /usr/lib/sendmail-compatible mailer, like exim\n\n\n# setup\n\n * create a "fat"/shaded jar using mvn clean install -prelease. if you have issues, check the build page.\n * copy whois-db/target/whois-db-<version>.jar to whois root directory and rename to whois.jar\n * copy the files tools/hazelcast.xml, whois-commons/src/test/resources/log4j2.xml from the repo to the whois root directory\n * copy whois-commons/src/test/resources/whois.properties from the repo to whois root directory and rename to properties\n * copy downloaded jmxterm jar to the whois root directory.\n * adjust properties to match your setup (e.g. jdbc urls, port numbers, etc...)\n   * for the example below we use port.query=1043 and port.api=1080 and port.nrtm=1081\n * create the databases whois_local, mailupdates_local, acl_local, internals_local.\n\ncreate database whois_local;\ncreate database mailupdates_local;\ncreate database acl_local;\ncreate database internals_local;\ncreate database nrtm_local;\n\n\nexplanation: firstly connect to mysql server with mysql command and then create database one by one with create database database_name command\n\n * for each of the above databases, run the *_schema.sql scripts found in ./whois/whois-commons/src/main/resources/.\n\nuse whois_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/whois_schema.sql\nuse mailupdates_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/mailupdates_schema.sql\nuse acl_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/acl_schema.sql\nuse internals_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/internals_schema.sql\nuse nrtm_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/nrtm_schema.sql\n\n\nexplanation: select database with command use database_name to be able to run schema on it with command source path_to_schema\n\n * for the ones that match, run their *_data.sql script equivalents found in ./whois/whois-commons/src/main/resources/.\n\nuse whois_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/whois_data.sql\nuse internals_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/internals_data.sql\nuse nrtm_local;\nsource ./whois-commons/src/main/resources/nrtm_data.sql\n\n\n * start whois by executing the following command. use -ddump.total.size.limit to specify the dump size:\n   \n   /usr/bin/java -dwhois -djsse.enablesniextension=false -dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -dhazelcast.jmx=true -dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -xms1024m -xmx8g -dwhois.config=properties -duser.timezone=utc -dhazelcast.config=hazelcast.xml -dlog4j.configurationfile=file:log4j2.xml -jar whois.jar\n   \n   \n   * if the test query for 193.0.0.1 does not result in an inetnum returned, the init script will return a failure. if your database is empty for example, this is normal. you might want to adjust the test whois query to match your needs.\n     \n     telnet localhost 1043\n     193.0.0.1\n     \n   \n   * ignore exceptions in the log starting with [databaseversioncheck] error checking datasource...\n\n * the logs will be printed in the console, notifying about the progress\n\n * kill the process to stop the server\n\n * use java --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=all-unnamed -jar jmxterm-1.0.4-uber.jar -v verbose to access the administrative interface exported via jmx\n\n\n# load local whois with initial test content\n\n * for testing purposes, use source=test in the properties file\n\n * make sure that in properties the port.query and port.api are not zero (e.g. 1043, 1080 respectively).\n\n * copy the file whois-scheduler/src/test/resources/test.db to the whois root directory\n   \n   * the file test.db contains an initial set of rpsl objects used for testing purposes.\n\n * while the server is running, use pgrep to find the server\'s pid (pgrep java)\n\n * now knowing the pid, while the server is still running, use jmx to load the database with the content of test.db:\n   \n   java --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=all-unnamed -jar jmxterm-1.0.4-uber.jar -v verbose\n   open (pid here)\n   bean net.ripe.db.whois:name=bootstrap\n   run loaddump comment test.db\n   \n\n * when the import is finished you should see a message in output like 220 succeeded (objects).\n\n * exit the jmx console\n\n * test that it worked by executing a query using telnet:\n   \n   telnet localhost 1043\n   10.11.11.0\n   \n\n * test the rest api with curl:\n   \n   curl http://localhost:1080/whois/test/inetnum/10.11.11.0/24\n   \n\nif you want to add content, you can use the test-dbm-mnt mntner whose password (emptypassword) is the remarks line.\n\n  curl http://localhost:1080/whois/test/mntner/test-dbm-mnt?password=emptypassword\n\n\nyou can check the instructions in whois-rest-api for more info about the rest api\n\n\n# how to allow unlimited queries\n\nthe whois server can block a client\'s ip as explained here.\n\nyou can allow unlimited queries from a certain ip by running a few queries as follows.\n\nthe database acl_local contains tables related to access control logic in whois. let\'s say that the blocked ip is 192.168.0.1.\n\n  insert into acl_local.acl_limit (prefix, daily_limit, comment, unlimited_connections)\n  values\n  (\'192.168.0.1/32\', -1, \'a comment\', 10000000);\n\n\nalso make sure there is no other line with the same prefix (192.168.0.1/32) in this table.\n\nalso run the following, just in case this ip is permanently denied:\n\n  delete from acl_local.acl_denied where prefix = \'192.168.0.1/32\'\n  delete from acl_local.acl_event where prefix = \'192.168.0.1/32\';\n\n\nif mariadb says that no row was affected, it is fine.\n\nif your client has ipv6, use the ipv6/64 prefix.\n\ncommit the changes and in a couple of minutes the whois server will pick it up and will not block that ip again.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# conventions used in the ripe database documentation\n\nthe following conventions are used:\n\n * <label> indicates a placeholder or syntax.\n * [option] indicates optional text or command argument.\n * bold font indicates an object type.\n * "attribute:" indicates an attribute of an object.\n * ‘value\' indicates the value of an attribute.\n\nthe term "ripe database" is used in several ways depending on the context. it may mean the:\n\n * entire service\n * database software\n * interface\n * logical database\n * database contents\n\nwhere there is any doubt, we will clarify what is being discussed.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# intended audience\n\nthis documentation has been written for both casual and experienced users of the ripe database. this documentation assumes a basic knowledge of computing. it also covers more technical aspects for users who wish to run their own local instance of the ripe database software.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# ripe database documentation overview\n\nthis is the starting point for information about the ripe database. everything that you need to know to use the ripe database will be described within these pages. if anything is missing or unclear, please contact us and we will do our best to help.\n\nthe format of this documentation is a master index with headings and sub-headings. each of these (sub-)headings links to a separate web page. this web page may be an index page to a series of other web pages. this documentation explains the ripe database in a large collection of small documents on specific topics with a comprehensive index so that the information is easy to find.\n\nthere is a glossary of terms and definitions that explains the meaning of commonly used terminology, phrases, words and acronyms related to the ripe database. there is also a set of references to other articles, standards and agreements relating to the ripe database.\n\nthere is a strong relationship between the full set of documentation and software releases. with every new release, the whole set of documents will be updated to reflect the changes in the software. the previous sets of documentation will still be available to view online or download as a pdf document.\n\nthese documents describe the technical features of the ripe database and how to use it. for a full explanation of why the ripe database works the way it does you may need to refer to the relevant ripe documents.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# notifications\n\nthe ripe database returns different types of information to various specified users. when a user submits an update, an acknowledgement (ack) message is returned to that user. this may an email message or via some other http connection. by using any of the notification attributes, notification (notif) messages can be sent to specified users who want to know about certain operations on one or more objects. these notif messages are always sent by email.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# acknowledgment message\n\nthe acknowledgement (ack) message is always returned to the user who submitted the update to the database, however, the ack message is a unique notification because it is returned via the same method that was used to submit the update. so, for an email update, the ack message is returned to the email address that sent the update. for any other update method, the ack message is returned as an http response.\n\nthe original style of the ack message was designed for an email update response. the same ack message was later used for both syncupdates and webupdates. now webupdates has a more customised web style of ack message, but syncupdates still uses the original email ack message style. the restful api response is totally different and returns either xml or json.\n\nregardless of the update method, one ack message is returned for each update. the results of all operations on all objects contained in the update are included in the single ack message. for all updates, an ack message that is in the original email style is always generated by the database software. this is logged in the ripe ncc\'s internal log of database changes, along with copies of all notif messages.\n\n\n# email acknowledgement message\n\nthis ack message holds the overall result of the update, which either ‘failed\' or was a total ‘success\'. if the update included several objects and the operation on any of those objects failed, then the overall result is ‘failed\'. if no individual operation failed, then the overall result is ‘success\'. this includes any individual ‘noop\' results where no operation was carried out, as the submitted object was identical to the object already in the database. this overall result is stated at the start of the subject line of the ack email sent to the user. any user comment on the subject line of the submitted update follows this result.\n\nsubject: success: some user comment\ndate:    thu, 11 sep 2014 10:42:15 +0200 (cest)\nfrom:    ripe database administration local <unread@ripe.net>\nto:      denis@ripe.net\n\n\nthe acknowledgement message content is split into sections. the first section shows from where the update was sent. this could be a copy of the update email header or the ip address for a synchronous connection. this section also includes a summary of the update results, explaining how many objects were recognised by the database software, how many operations were successful and how many failed.\n\nan example first section of an acknowledgment message would look like this:\n\n>  from:       denis walker <denis@ripe.net>\n>  subject:    some user comment\n>  date:       thu, 11 sep 2014 10:42:14 +0200\n>  reply-to:   denis walker <denis@ripe.net>\n>  message-id: <54116066.7030403@ripe.net>\n\nsummary of update:\n\nnumber of objects found:                   5\nnumber of objects processed successfully:  4\ncreate:         1\nmodify:         2\ndelete:         0\nno operation:   1\nnumber of objects processed with errors:   1\ncreate:         0\nmodify:         1\ndelete:         0\n\n\nthe next section is the "detailed explanation" of the acknowledgement message. this is split into three parts.\n\n * the first part lists all the objects where the operation failed. this will include "***error:" messages as well as possible "***info:" and "***warning:" messages.\n * the next part shows all the operations that were successful. this may include additional "***info:" and "***warning:" messages with each operation listed.\n * the third part lists all the paragraphs from the update message that were not recognised as objects.\n\neach part is separated in the ack by a line containing several \'~\' characters. within each part, the objects and paragraphs are listed in the order that they were processed. this is generally the order that they appear in the update message unless ‘auto-n\' nic handles are referenced. the line before each object contains three hyphen characters (-) . this allows for easy parsing by script.\n\nbelow is an example of this section of the acknowledgement message:\n\ndetailed explanation: \n\n***warning: invalid keyword(s) found: some user comment\n***warning: all keywords were ignored\n\n    \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthe following object(s) were found to have errors:      \n\n\n---\nupdate failed: [person] dn1172-ripe          de nis\n***error: syntax error in object\n\nperson:          de nis\naddress:         here\nphone:           1\n***error: syntax error in "1"\nnic-hdl:          dn1172-ripe\nmnt-by:         test-mnt\nsource:          ripe\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthe following object(s) were processed successfully:\n\n\n---\nmodify succeeded: [person] dn1172-ripe          de nis\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthe following paragraph(s) do not look like objects\nand were not processed:\n\nthis is a private email.\nit is intended only for the named recipient.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nthere are many reasons why the operation may fail for an object, including syntax error, authorisation failure and failed business rules check.\n\n~\n\n\n\n# syncupdates acknowledgement message\n\nthere are only two differences between an ack message returned from a syncupdate update and an ack message returned from an email update. the ‘success\' or ‘failed\' result shown in the email\'s subject line is now shown as a code in the first line of a syncupdates response. however, this response code does not provide the same information. an update that fails with an authorisation error will return response code 403. any other object update failure,or success, will return response code 200. this indicates that the update was successfully processed. it does not mean that all the objects in the update message were successful operations. this must be determined from the numbers of successes and failures in the summary part of the message output.\n\nif you use syncupdates via the web form (see the section \'syncupdates\') there is no response code. all information has to be interpreted using the content of the ack message.\n\nthe second difference is also in the first section of the ack message. whereas the email ack message gives details of the received email, the syncupdates ack message gives details of the ip address sending in the update.\n\n- from-host: 2001:67c:2e8:13:198e:207d:6a7:47c5\n- date/time: fri sep 12 11:39:37 2014\n\n\n\n# webupdates acknowledgement message\n\nthe webupdates ack message is very different to both the email and syncupdates ack message. only a single object is allowed in a webupdates update message. if the update is successful one of the following messages is added to the top of the output:\n\n * object successfully created\n * object successfully updated!\n * person object di1432-ripe successfully deleted\n\nif the update fails, the errors are shown in different ways depending on the web format that you are using. if you are using the field format, a general error message may be displayed at the top of the form:\n\n\n\na specific error will be added, immediately after the attribute that contains the actual error:\n\n\n\nif it is a general error that does not relate to a specific attribute, but rather to the whole update, this error message will be shown at the top of the output:\n\n\n\nif you are using the single text area, error messages cannot be added after the attribute that contains the error. therefore, in this case, all error messages will appear at the top of the output:\n\n\n\n\n# restful api acknowledgement message\n\nthe ack message for an api update is returned as either an xml or json response. the response includes the object that was submitted in the update. if there was an error, an error message section is included at the end of the response. for example an xml error response would include this section:\n\n<errormessages>\n    <errormessage severity="error" text="syntax error in %s">\n        <attribute name="phone" value="31 20 535 4444"/>\n        <args value="31 20 535 4444"/>\n    </errormessage>\n</errormessages>\n\n\nfor a creation, using the api, that returns an error message, the output is the same as for an api update. if creation is successful, the version of the object that has been added to the database is returned. this may be different to the version that was submitted in the update if it has any generated attributes.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# notification messages\n\nthere are a number of attributes that may cause notification (notif) messages to be generated:\n\n * "notify:"\n * "mnt-nfy:"\n * "upd-to:"\n * "irt-nfy:"\n * "ref-nfy:"\n\nwhere there are multiple instances of any notification attribute, all email values will be sent an individual notif message email. where the notification attribute is contained in a referenced object (for example, in a mntner) and there are multiple references, all the referenced objects will be taken to form a list of email addresses. all these addresses will be sent an individual notif message email. updates can contain multiple objects. these objects can contain different sets of notification email addresses. some of the notification email addresses may appear in more than one set. each email address to be sent a notif message has its own individual message generated that only contains details of the objects that reference that email address. so each notif message that is sent may contain different information.\n\nthere are many attributes related to notifications. these may be contained in many related objects. all the notification attributes can take multiple values and all appropriate email addresses will be used. it is not always obvious why you have received a notification. you can find out why you received a notification by following all references from the object(s) listed in the notification message and looking at the notification attributes that all of these objects contain.\n\n\n# notification attributes\n\nthe "notify:" attribute is an optional attribute in all object types. it is used when an object is successfully created or updated. the "notify:" attribute of the old version of the object is used if the object is being modified. if the update fails for any reason then no notifications will be sent to any "notify:" email addresses.\n\nthe optional "mnt-nfy:" and mandatory "upd-to:" attributes can only be included in mntner objects.\n\nwhen a maintained object is updated successfully, a notification message will be sent to email addresses contained in all "mnt-nfy:" attributes of all mntner objects that are referenced by the updated object.\n\nsometimes an update fails one or more of the required authentications. this is considered a security issue. it could mean that someone is attempting to gain control of or change your data. in this case, notifications are sent to all the email addresses contained in all the "upd-to:" attributes of all the mntner objects that are referenced by the object in the update. this is sometimes the only attribute holding an email address that is associated with an object. the ripe ncc may occasionally use this email address to contact someone related to an object in the ripe database for any security-related issue. more general issues may also be raised addressed using this email address if this is the only contact point for an object.\n\nthe optional "irt-nfy:" attribute is only allowed in an irt object. this is used when a reference to an irt object is added to, or removed from, an inetnum or inet6num object (by means of the "mnt-irt:" attribute).\n\nthe optional "ref-nfy:" attribute is only allowed in an organisation object. this is used when a reference to an organisation object is added to an object (using the "org:" attribute).\n\n\n# format of the notification message\n\nthe format of a notification message is similar to the ack message for an email update. the first section of the message explains why you are being sent this notification. the next section of the notification message has the email header or ip address details showing where the update came from. the final section shows the changes that were contained in the update message, if it was successful. for a creation it shows the newly created object. for a deletion, it shows the object that was deleted. for a modification, it shows the new version of the object. in this case, a ‘diff\' is also included to show the difference between the original object and the new object. if the modification update failed, the current version of the object is shown and the diff shows the change that was being attempted.\n\nif using passwords in an update message, be cautious when entering this. if you mistype the password pseudo-attribute (eg "password: clear_password") the notification will include your clear text password.\n\nthe "upd-to:" attribute in a mntner object should only include the email address of a person or team in your organisation who deals with security issues. if this team receives a notification containing a clear text password, they should advise the user to change their password.\n\neach notification message is only sent to a single email address. there is no email address copied (via cc) in any notification. when multiple email addresses need to be notified of the same update, each address will receive its own email. this email will contain all notification details of objects that are contained in the update message that relates to that email address. for an update with multiple objects, referencing several mntner objects, where several objects have a variety of notification attributes, the software builds a matrix of email addresses and updated objects. this ensures that only the appropriate details are sent to each email address.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# related software and tools\n\n\n# ripe database tools\n\nthe ripe database is a bsd licensed open source project on github. you can read, verify and contribute to the source code. if you find a bug in the ripe database, please ket us know. on this page you can find an overview of all tools to help you manage your ripe database objects.\n\n\n# reset a lost md5 maintainer password\n\nif you lost your md5 password, you can use this form to request a reset. it requires you to log in with your ripe ncc access (sso) account, which you can create if you don\'t have one yet. if possible, the process should be completely automated, but in some cases it may require intervention from a customer services representative. please note that our policy is to replace a lost md5 password with a ripe ncc access (sso) account, as this is more secure and allows you to reset a lost password seamlessly in the future.\n\n\n# my resources\n\nmy resources offers an overview of all ipv4, ipv6 and asn resources you hold or sponsor at a glance. it displays allocation usage, as well as an overview of all more specific ranges that have been created under each allocation. an inline editor allows for intuitive updates.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# geolocation in the ripe database\n\nthe ripe ncc is not a geolocation provider. following a unanimous decision by the ripe ncc executive board not to support resource expenditure in the area of geolocation services, the ripe ncc has no plans to become a provider.\n\na number of companies provide geolocation services, including:\n\n * abstract\n * apiip\n * bigdatacloud.com\n * fastah™ api on aws marketplace and azure marketplace\n * geoip® by maxmind\n * live geoip\n * ip2location\n * ipapi by kloudend\n * ipapi.is\n * ipdata.co\n * ipgeolocation.io\n * ipinfo.io\n * ipregistry\n * ipwhois.io\n * neustar\n\nif you are a geolocation provider and would like to be added to this list, please contact us.\n\nthe ripe database offers the "geoloc:" attribute on organisation and inet(6)num objects that may or may not be used as an additional source of information by these providers.\n\nif you want to update the geolocation on your inet(6)num object you can do so using webupdates. just search for your object and update it. to add a "geoloc:" attribute, click the "+" icon and select the "geoloc:" attribute. the value can be entered as two floating point numbers if you know the longitude and latitude. please be aware that this information may not be picked up by geolocation providers.\n\nif you want to find the geolocation of an ip resource, you can use the ripestat geolocation widget.\n\nplease be aware that geolocation information is added by the resource holders in the ripe database and the ripe ncc does not verify this information.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# ripe database release notes\n\nthis page will be updated with every release of the ripe database software. the version number of the production software is visible at the end of each query as a comment and is also presented at the end of each update acknowledgement.\n\nyou can test an upcoming release candidate (rc)

release candidate environment contains the upcoming release of the database software with a dummified snapshot of the production data. the dummification is only applied to personal data. this environment makes it possible for you to test your software with upcoming versions of the ripe database.\n\n\n# information about services\n\nservice           location\ncommand line      whois-rc.ripe.net, port 43\nsyncupdates       https://syncupdates-rc.db.ripe.net\nrest api          https://rest-rc.db.ripe.net\nrdap api          https://rdap-rc.db.ripe.net\nweb application   https://rc.db.ripe.net\nmailupdates       rc-dbm@ripe.net\n\n\n# differences from live ripe database\n\n * for each mntner object in the release candidate database, the passwords have been set to the object id. for example, the object:\n\ninetnum: 193.0.0.0 - 103.0.7.255 ... mnt-by: ninja-mnt ... can be changed by supplying the password: ninja-mnt. regardless of the passwords used in the live ripe database, in the release candidate database they have been adjusted to reflect the mntner id.\n\n * the databases are snapshots of live ripe database data, dummified in the beginning of each new testing period. personal data is replaced during the dummification process.\n * no emails are sent from the release candidate system. this means no response from mailupdates submissions to the release candidate database, no ack or notify emails are sent by the release candidate database.\n\n\n# notes\n\nas in the live ripe database, access control lists (acls) are active. even though the personal data in the release candidate database is dummified, acls are active to ensure it operates in the same way as the production system.\n\neven though the release candidate database contains snapshot of the live data from the start of the testing period, no changes made to the release candidate database will have any impact on the live ripe database data. the two are completely separated.\n\nany scripts or automated processes you use to maintain your data in the ripe database can be used with the release candidate database - simple adjust the urls accordingly. the whole purpose is to allow you to test your processes as closely as possible to the action ripe database using newly developed and released software.\n\n\n# ripe database release 1.100\n\n\n# date of deployment\n\nrelease

is authorised by the ripe community to act as the registration authority and keep an accurate register of internet number resources in its service region and to manage the operation of the ripe database. many of the operational responsibilities for data handling are delegated to the individuals who have mntner objects in the database. these individuals, or maintainers, maintain sets of data related to their ip network operations.\n\nif one of these maintainers fails to fulfill their data protection responsibilities, the ripe ncc could have a legal obligation to intervene. this may require the ripe ncc to modify or delete personal contact details. the procedure outlined in this document balances maintaining accountability with the privacy rights of individuals.\n\n\n# definitions\n\nin this document, the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nripe ncc – reseaux ip europeens network coordination centre. a membership association under dutch law operating its registered office in amsterdam, the netherlands.\n\nripe community – ripe (reseaux ip europeens) is a collaborative forum open to all parties interested in wide area ip networks in europe and beyond. the objective of ripe is to ensure the administrative and technical coordination necessary to enable the operation of a pan-european ip network.\n\nupdate – submitting information for entry into or removal from the ripe database.\n\ninternet number resource – globally unique address space (ipv4 and ipv6) and autonomous system numbers (asns) issued by any internet number registry.\n\nprimary objects – internet number resources and other data object types that are not directly related to any other primary object type and which are defined by routing policy specification language (rpsl) or which have been agreed by the ripe community as acceptable primary data.\n\nripe database – the publicly available data collection of internet number registry (inr) and internet routing registry (irr) data published by the ripe ncc. it contains all the primary and secondary objects. there is also some non-public data required for the operation of the ripe database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the ripe database.\n\nregistrant – a natural person or legal entity to whom an internet number resource has been registered or who has registered any other primary object in the ripe database by specific or general agreement with the ripe ncc.\n\nmaintainer – any registrant or person to whom the authority to update has been delegated by a registrant, either directly or indirectly, and who holds an identifier that allows updates to be authenticated and authorised.\n\nend user – a person for whom an internet number resource has been registered for their use.\n\ndata subject – a natural person whose personal contact details or other personal data are recorded in the ripe database.\n\ncontact details – all details relating to name, postal address, phone, fax, e-mail or any other form of electronic communication that is used by a natural person or a legal entity.\n\npersonal contact details – contact details pertaining to a natural person.\n\ninternet registry – any registry that makes internet number resources available to other people and records information in a database about the registrant.\n\n\n# general\n\npersonal contact details are held in several object types (see appendix g) the person object is the starting point for all data sets in the ripe database and this procedure will focus on these objects.\n\nchanges to personal contact details can have significant consequences. to change or remove personal contact details may require:\n\n * references to be removed from other objects.\n * some other objects to be deleted.\n * internet number resources to be returned to the appropriate internet registry.\n * registrant/maintainer to lose control and/or right of usage of the internet number resource.\n\nthe precise course of action depends on the type of object in which the person object is referenced. the ripe ncc has a legal obligation to remove personal contact details on request from the data subject in some situations.\n\nif the data subject is the registrant of an internet number resource and wishes to remain the registrant of that resource, the following options are available:\n\n * insert personal contact details for some other person from the data subject’s organisation.\n * insert contact details related to the maintainer of the resource if this is not the data subject. this option is only available if the maintainer agrees or if the maintainer is also the registrant.\n * insert contact details related to the organisation responsible for the parent resource (provided that this is not the ripe ncc). in this case, responsibility for maintaining the data should also pass to this parent resource organisation if they are not already the maintainer. this option is only available if the parent resource organisation agrees.\n * deny the request to remove personal contact details if the data subject is the registrant and does not wish to return the internet number resource, or the data subject is the maintainer and does not wish to release control over the resource and none of the above options are available.\n\nthe data subject needs to be aware of the consequences of removing personal contact details where the options above are not possible or acceptable. the data subject cannot maintain an internet number resource and be anonymous. where accountability for registrations of global resources conflicts with an individual’s right to privacy, drastic action may be required. this may involve returning internet number resources to the internet registry that issued them and removing all associated data from the ripe database.\n\n\n# procedure\n\nthe ripe ncc has tried to clearly identify a series of steps that can be taken at different stages. the aim is to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all parties and protect everyone’s interests while maintaining the ripe ncc’s responsibility as a public registry of internet number resources. the ripe ncc will always inform the data subject within four weeks in writing whether a request for change or removal of personal contact details will be granted. if the request is denied, the ripe ncc will duly motivate this decision. this procedure refers only to person objects for clarity, but other objects may be involved (see appendix g).\n\nthe steps that will be taken are as follows:\n\n 1. the ripe ncc is contacted by a data subject asking for their personal contact details to be removed from the ripe database. the data subject must clearly identify the details they are referring to by sending a copy of the personal contact details to the ripe ncc.\n 2. the ripe ncc forwards the request to the maintainer of the person object and copies the data subject on the\n    e-mail. the maintainer is asked to resolve the issue within ten working days and send confirmation to both the ripe ncc and the data subject.\n 3. a. if the ripe ncc receives confirmation from the maintainer that action has been taken, the ripe ncc notifies both the maintainer and the data subject that the case is closed.\n    b. if no confirmation is received from the maintainer, but the person object has been deleted or substantially changed, the ripe ncc notifies both the maintainer and the data subject that the issue has been resolved and the case is closed.\n    c. if no confirmation is received from the maintainer, and nothing has changed, the ripe ncc contacts the data subject and copies the message to the maintainer. the data subject is asked to confirm that they still want the personal contact details removed. if they confirm this, the ripe ncc moves to step 4 (below).\n\nthe following steps are the actions the ripe ncc will take when the maintainer does not respond to or does not comply with the request to change or remove contact details:\n\n 4. the ripe ncc asks the data subject for a copy of a legal identification document. this document must match the personal contact details to be removed. this should be faxed to the ripe ncc together with a formal request for the removal of the personal contact details.\n 5. the ripe ncc receives the signed request and identification document from the data subject.\n 6. if it is a simple case where:\n    * the person object is unreferenced.\n    * each object referencing the person object references more than one person object.\n 7. for a simple case, the ripe ncc sends an acknowledgement to the data subject and the maintainer informing them that the personal contact details have been removed and the case is closed.\n\nfor anything other than one of the simple cases, the ripe ncc continues with the following steps:\n\n 8.  the ripe ncc sends a statement to the data subject of actions to be taken, which includes a list of any other data that may be affected which is directly related to the person object and the changes that need to be made to this data. this list will highlight any resources that will need to be returned to an internet registry or transferred to another maintainer and the possible consequences of this action. these consequences may include the removal of some data from the ripe database.\n\n 9.  because of the referential integrity rules, when any data is removed from the ripe database, there can be a chain reaction. this may result in more data being changed or removed. the maintainers of any such data will be informed and requested to make the appropriate changes. these changes will have to be made before the data subject\'s details can be removed because no object can be deleted from the ripe database while it is still referenced.\n\n 10. if there is an option for data to be transferred to another maintainer but the latter maintainer is not willing to be the maintainer of this data, then there are only two options available:\n     \n     * the user must return the resource to the appropriate internet registry and their personal contact details will be removed.\n     * the user’s personal contact details cannot be removed but can be corrected if there is an error.\n     \n     in the former case, if the data subject confirms the action, the ripe ncc moves into the clean-up phase. in the latter case, any corrections will be applied and the case is closed.\n\n 11. a. if the data subject confirms the action in the statement, the ripe ncc moves into the clean-up phase.\n     b. if the data subject does not confirm this action, no further action is possible and the case is closed.\n\n\n# clean-up phase\n\nthis is the procedure taken by the ripe ncc when the removal of personal contact details is not a simple case. the actual implementation is very technical and requires some recursive searching for references.\n\nthe goal is to remove the person object containing the data subject’s personal contact details. all reference chains must be followed and appropriate changes made as close in the chain as possible to the person object to maintain the referential integrity of the ripe database.\n\nif an object needs to be deleted, special considerations may apply, depending on the object type (see appendix f). this may involve returning some resources to the appropriate internet registries. if these resources are registered to the data subject requesting the removal of personal contact details, the resources will be listed in the statement to the data subject together with the consequences. if the resources are managed by other maintainers, the maintainers will be notified and given an opportunity to change the references and take their resources off the list of affected objects. this must be done before the data subject’s personal contact details can be removed.\n\n\n# conclusion\n\nit is easier for all concerned if the maintainers make any necessary changes to the personal contact details. the maintainers are closer to the people involved and have a better understanding of how to replace references to the data subject. if the ripe ncc has to make changes it is because the maintainer of the data has not responded in a timely manner. in this case, the drastic actions detailed in this procedure, including requiring resources to be returned, are necessary.\n\nbecause the procedure requires drastic actions in some cases, it is important that the ripe ncc can contact the right people to inform them of the actions in advance. currently, the ripe ncc has no authoritative contact details for the maintainer of many sets of data objects. the ripe ncc only has the set of e-mail addresses listed in the objects in the ripe database. few of these have been verified and some may prove to be invalid. the ripe ncc will consider the maintainer to have been informed by sending an e-mail to the address listed in the ripe database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# ripe database acceptable use policy\n\n\n# definitions\n\nin the acceptable use policy (aup), the following terms shall be understood to have the meanings assigned to them below:\n\nripe ncc – reseaux ip europeens network coordination centre. a membership association under dutch law operating its registered office in amsterdam, the netherlands.\n\nupdate – submitting information for entry into or removal from the ripe database\n\nquery – requesting information from the ripe database access – update and query the ripe database\n\nripe database – the publicly available data collection of internet number registry (inr) and internet routing registry (irr) data published by the ripe ncc. it contains all the primary and secondary objects. there is also some non-public data required for the operation of the ripe database and the registries, but this non-public data does not form part of the ripe database.\n\nuser – anyone who accesses the ripe database or causes access to be made. this includes registrants and maintainers, as defined in the ripe database terms and conditions.\n\nabuse-c – an attribute referencing a role object holding abuse contact information, to be included in inetnum, inet6num and aut-num objects, intended for receiving automatic and manual reports about abusive behaviour originating in resource holder\'s networks.\n\nsso account – the ripe ncc access (single sign-on) account users can access ripe ncc services through.\n\n\n# introduction\n\nthe following principles define the purpose of this policy. without prejudice to the applicability of the ripe database terms and conditions, this policy is to ensure that:\n\n * the usage of the ripe database is in line with the purpose of the ripe database as defined in the ripe database terms and conditions.\n * no copy of a significant part of the ripe database is made without the consent of the ripe ncc.\n * we protect the personal data held within the ripe database. the ripe database service is only used as intended and defined in documents and manuals associated with the service.\n * all users comply with the limits set on their access to the ripe database services.\n * we do not put the ripe database services at risk.\n * our general policies (e.g., on pricing, fees, privacy, data protection and access) are not compromised.\n * users do not act in a way that disrupts the ripe database services for other users.\n\nthe ripe database terms and conditions permit the ripe ncc to block access to the ripe database services by any user for abuse, or suspend access for suspected abuse.\n\nplease note that we have a standard clause on anti-avoidance and connected persons that forms part of this policy (see below).\n\nwe may reject queries originated by users who have exceeded their limit or who are subject to sanctions for abuse without regard to their limit.\n\n\n# limits\n\nthese are the limits currently set by the ripe ncc for using the ripe database services.\n\nquery service\n\n * number of queries from an ip address – unlimited [1]\n * number of queries passed by a proxy – unlimited [1]\n * number of personal data sets returned in queries from an ip address – 1,000 per 24 hours [3][4]\n * number of personal data sets returned in queries from a proxy ip address – 20,000 per 24 hours [3][4]\n * number of personal data sets returned in queries from an sso account – 1,000 per 24 hours [3][4]\n\nupdate service\n\n * number of update e-mails sent to auto-dbm@ripe.net – unlimited [1]\n * number of updates submitted through the syncupdates interface – unlimited [1]\n * number of updates submitted through the webupdates interface – unlimited [1]\n * number of objects contained in a single update message – 5,000\n * size of a single update message – 500kb\n * number of queued e-mail update messages from any one e-mail address – 100\n\ngeneral\n\n * number of simultaneous connections to the ripe database server – 3 [2]\n\n\n# anti-avoidance and connected persons\n\none way that the principles of this policy can be compromised is if users try to give the impression that they are separate, or claim to be separate, when in fact they are acting together to pool their limits, for example. if the ripe ncc believes users are acting in a coordinated way to bypass the above limits, we will consider the situation and act on a case-by-case basis. references\n\n\n# references\n\n[1] where no limits are set, or a limit is set as unlimited, we work on the basis of reasonable use. this means that we expect users not to do anything that could abuse or damage the ripe database service or cause service disruption for other users. if we detect any user causing problems we may, at our sole discretion, slow down or temporarily or permanently block access to the ripe database services for that user.\n\n[2] queries can be sent to the ripe database without the need to wait for the previous query to return.\n\n[3] if the number of personal data sets limit is exceeded, the user will be temporarily blocked from making any queries to the ripe database from the ip address, or sso account, submitting the queries for personal data. the number of queries accepted from the temporarily blocked ip address or sso account will recover exponentially over time. this will allow a slower query rate for some time. however, if a user is temporarily blocked several times, or continues to submit queries excessively even while blocked, they will be permanently blocked from querying the ripe database from that ip address or sso account, as the case may be. despite the set limits for queries by the ripe database user, the email contacts which are included in the ”abuse-c” attribute are meant to be available with no restrictions to bulk access. because this attribute can potentially be filled in with email addresses that could be considered to be personal, it is the maintainer\'s responsibility to inform the individual whose personal details will be referenced in the ripe database and obtain their consent for use of their data.\n\n[4] queries which are made to the ripe database by a user logged into their sso account will be accounted for separately from the ip address of that user. this means that if a user is logged in to their sso account, any query for objects containing personal data will be counted against their sso account and not their ip address. if a user is not logged into their sso account any queries for objects containing personal data will be counted against their ip address.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# access to nrtm\n\n\n# abstract\n\nthis document describes show to access a ripe near real time mirror (nrtm) database data stream from the ripe ncc.\n\n\n# introduction\n\nnear real time mirroring (nrtm) is a mechanism that allows any client to receive a stream of available data from a database on a server operated by the ripe ncc. the client can receive this stream of data modification from the server in near real time. the server will determine what data is made available to the client. some data will be excluded from the stream or modified before sending. this is described below. the client pulls available data from the server by submitting requests. these requests can be periodic or continuous. the client can be initialised to a known state and the data stream can then be requested to continue with updates from that point onwards. however, updates are only available from the server as a data stream for two weeks. if the client has requested no updates for this period, then the client will need to be reinitialised.\n\nthe nrtm database made available by the ripe ncc does not include any custom software or proprietary database engine with which to utilise the data.\n\nnote that it is not possible for users to mirror any of the ripe ncc mirrored databases (for instance, other rir databases). if you need a nrtm data stream from any other source you must contact that source directly.\n\n\n# nrtm protocols\n\ncurrently there are two versions of the nrtm protocols available, version 2 and version 3. there is backwards compatibility between the two versions.\n\nthe ripe database server generates a serial number every time it processes an update in the database. when generating these serial numbers, the server describes all modifications to the database in terms of two atomic operations: deletion and addition.\n\nversion 2 sends some data from every serial in the data stream. where the real data is excluded, dummy data must be sent to maintain the sequence of serials.\n\nversion 3 adds the serial number after the operation command for each update in the data stream. this eliminates the need to send dummy objects to keep serials in sync.\n\ncurrently, either version can be used. it is possible to switch between the versions. we would recommend using version 3. this allows you to process a more condensed data stream, leading to a cleaner database without the clutter of excessive dummy objects.\n\n\n# excluded data\n\nthe ripe nrtm database made available by this service does not include the full set of data contained in the ripe database. it specifically excludes:\n\n * personal data (person and role objects)\n * organisation details (organisation object)\n * security data (mntner object)\n * references to personal data (nic handles)\n\nfor both version 2 and 3 of the nrtm protocol the mntner and organisation objects are replaced in the data stream by dummy data. these are placeholder objects. they still contain the primary key and other objects make references to these objects.\n\nin version 2 of the nrtm protocol, the person and role objects are also replaced in the data stream by dummy data. however, the same dummy person object replaces all person and role objects. all references in other objects to person and role objects will refer to this single dummy person object.\n\nin version 3 of the nrtm protocol, the person and role objects are completely omitted from the data stream. because the serials are included with each object in the data stream, it is not necessary to maintain placeholders.\n\nif a client is blocked from whois for excessive querying of personal data, they will also be blocked from nrtm.\n\n\n# initial setup\n\nan initial data set is available from our ftp site. it is available in two formats:\n\n * individual data files\n * single data file\n\nthe individual data files contain data for each object type in separate text files. the excluded data (described above) is not available from these files. the set of files can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/split\n\nall the data from the "optional" attributes has been removed from the files for the organisation and mntner objects. all of the data from the "mandatory" attributes has been replaced with standard dummy data, except for the primary key value. so, for a mntner object, only the "mntner:" attribute will contain any real data. the files for person and role objects contain only a single dummy person object with the nic handle \'dumy-ripe\'.\n\nthe single file is a merged data set of all the individual data files in a single text file. it contains the excluded organisation and mntner objects as dummy objects and a single person and role dummy object. this can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.db.gz\n\nall of these files are produced on a daily basis. only the most recent file is available from the dtp site. each database update has a serial number and these serials define the data pulled from an nrtm data stream. the latest update serial included in the data files is held in a separate text file on the ftp site: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.currentserial\n\nyou will need this serial number to know which serial to start pulling from the nrtm data stream. note that only update serials from the previous 14 days can be pulled from the ripe nrtm database server. if you have not pulled any data from the nrtm stream for more than 14 days, you will need to download the above text files again, reinitialise your database and start from the new serial number. you may want to keep track of the serials that you pull from the nrtm data stream. if you have any gaps that are older than 14 days, then you will need to download all the text files again.\n\n\n# accessing the data stream\n\nto receive data from the nrtm data stream you must first connect to the host server and then pull selected data from it.\n\nthe client must connect to the host whois.ripe.net at port 4444.\n\nwhen sending data to a client using the version 2 protocol, the server will send one of two strings ("add" or "del") followed by two line-break characters (\\n\\n) and then the corresponding object. this will either be the object as it was before deletion or the object as it should appear after being created or modified. if an object already existing in the database follows the "add" string, the client software should treat this as a modification.\n\nwith the version 3 protocol the serial follows the operation string ("add" or "del") on the same line. all other returned data is the same as for version 2.\n\nafter connecting to the server, the client can request data by using the -g query flag. the arguments to this query flag are: -g <source> :<nrtm_protocol_version_#>:<first>-<last>\n\nwhere\n\n * <source> is the string that identifies the server database that is being mirrored (only ripe is available).\n * <nrtm_protocol_version_#> is the version of the mirroring protocol that the <source> supports (this should be 2 or 3 for the source ripe).\n * <first> is the lowest serial number requested.\n * <last> is the most recent serial number requested. if the keyword "last" is used, this tells the server to send all updates up to the most recent one available at the time of the request.\n\nthis is an example of accessing the nrtm data stream using telnet and pulling the serials from 11012700 to the latest available.\n\n$ telnet whois.ripe.net 4444\ntrying 193.0.0.135...\nconnected to whois.ripe.net.\nescape character is \'^]\'.\n\n-g ripe:3:11012700-last\n\n% rights restricted by copyright.\n%

disconnection for some time. clients should set the tcp socket option so_keepalive to enable the standard tcp keepalive mechanism. clients should also set the keepalive interval option on every connection, as the system-wide default is very long. this option is platform-specific.\n\n * linux\n   \n   * set so_keepalive socket option.\n   * system-wide default is 2 hours. read the current value in seconds using: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time\n   * the defaults can be changed on a per-socket basis\n     * tcp_keepidle (the time to wait on an idle connection, before sending a

and more information about nrtm in this document.\n\n\n# legal framework\n\nthe ripe ncc nrtm service and its use is regulated by the ripe database terms and conditions and ripe database acceptable use policy.\n\n\n# transferring to a third party\n\ntransferring and/or making available of the nrtm service and/or the data downloaded therefrom to a third party is only allowed, provided the following conditions are met:\n\n * the user obtains prior written permission from the ripe ncc\n * the user ensures that third party accepts the ripe database terms and conditions for this purpose.\n * the user identifies the ripe ncc as the source of the data and will explicitly state that this data is near-real time and may not reflect the latest data contained in the ripe database.\n * the user maintains the overall integrity of the data (e.g. will not misrepresent, falsify or exclude any data).\n\nthe ripe ncc reserves the right to revoke this permission at any time if the user fails to meet any of these conditions.\n\n\n# contact\n\nif you have any more questions, please contact us.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# near real time mirroring v4\n\nnrtmv4 is a protocol for database mirroring that improves upon existing protocols by publishing records via an https endpoint, using periodic snapshots files and regular delta files. it includes integrity checks through signing and enhances scalability by generating files once and distributing them over https. for more information, refer to draft-ietf-grow-nrtm-v4.html.\n\nthis protocol has draft rfc status and is subject to change.\n\n\n# snapshot initialization\n\nwe initialise the snapshot during the first export for the database or if there is a history lost and cannot produce continuous deltas. the server notifies to the user when this happens, to ensure that the client have a complete view or need to reinitialise.\n\n 1. a session id (random v4 uuid) is generated. this token is unique for ripe database.\n 2. a new snapshot is generated for version one, this snapshot may be empty if the database is empty.\n 3. a new update notification file is generated with the same session id created in the first step. the session id is referencing the update notification file with the snapshot. this first snapshot doesn\'t have any delta.\n 4. we update the update notification file with the new contents.\n\neach database (i.e: ripe and ripe-nonauth) has separate session ids, snapshots, deltas and update notification files, even if published by the same server instance.\n\n\n# publishing updates\n\n\n# update notification file\n\nthe update notification file is essential for mirror clients to determine changes between their local database state and the ripe database. it provides:\n\n * information on the snapshot file and delta files.\n * timestamp for freshness checking.\n\nthe update notification file ensure efficient and accurate synchronisation between the ripe database and the client\'s database by providing clear metadata, previse change details, and robust validation mechanisms. clients must rely on this file to maintain up-to-date copies of the ripe database.\n\n 1. nrtm_version: must be 4\n 2. timestamp: is adhered to rfc3339 format, providing an accurate timestamp of when the update notification file was generated.\n 3. type: must be "notification".\n 4. next_signing_key: (optional) if present, denotes that public key for future key rotation.\n 5. source: identifies the source (i.e: ripe, ripe-nonauth), ensuring consistency with the ripe database data.\n 6. session_id: it is a unique v4 uuid assigned to this session and source, crucial for synchronisation and tracking.\n 7. version: represents the latest version number, aligning with the highest version of the included snapshot and deltas.\n 8. snapshot: contains the details of the snapshot file, including the version, url foe retrieval, and sha-256 hash for integrity verification.\n 9. deltas: list all delta files with their respective version numbers, urls, and hashes ensuring sequential continuity and data integrity checks.\n\nmore information here.\n\n * example:\n\n{\n

contains the complete and current contents of the ripe database, and clients should use it to initialise or reinitialise their local database copies.\n\nto avoid issues where a client retrieves an update notification file just before it is updated, servers should retain old snapshot files for at least 5 minutes after a new update notification file is published. this allows clients to complete the retrieval of the snapshot without encountering inconsistencies.\n\nthe snapshot file is formatted as json text sequences. it contains one or more records. the first record is the header, followed by the rpsl records.\n\n 1. a new snapshot file will be generated every day between 1 am and 2 am.\n 2. nrtm_version: must be set to 4.\n 3. version: must be an unsigned positive integer and match the version field in the update notification file.\n 4. type: must be "snapshot".\n 5. source: must match the source field in the update notification file.\n 6. session_id: must match the session_id in the update notification file.\n 7. it is cached for 1 week. it is an immutable file.\n\nmore information here.\n\n * example:\n\n{\n  "nrtm_version": 4,\n  "type": "snapshot",\n  "source": "ripe",\n  "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",\n  "version": 3\n}\n{"object": "route: 192.0.2.0/24\\norigin: as65530\\nsource: ripe"}\n{"object": "route: 2001:db8::/32\\norigin: as65530\\nsource: ripe"}\n\n\n\n# delta file\n\ndelta files are used for keeping track of the changes done to the database. the delta file is always compared with the previous delta file, so there will never be a version 1. the first delta will be compared with the initialized snapshot and will have the version number 2.\n\ndelta files are used to record changes to rpsl objects between snapshots. they ensure that clients can keep their databases synchronized with the source by applying only the changes that occurred since the last synchronization.\n\n 1.  if there have been changes, a delta file is published each minute.\n 2.  all the changes are included, even if some cancel each other out, like an addition and deletion of the same object.\n 3.  each delta file have a version number one greater than the last delta file or snapshot file version.\n 4.  all the changes are in order they occurred during the time frame.\n 5.  deltas older than 24 hours will be removed, after generating a new one.\n 6.  update notification file will include the new delta file and the updated database version.\n 7.  must match the session_id of the update notification file.\n 8.  must match the source of the update notification file.\n 9.  nrtm_version: must be set to 4.\n 10. type: must be delta.\n 11. it is cached for one week. it is an immutable file.\n\nmore information here\n\n * example:\n\n{\n  "nrtm_version": 4,\n  "type": "delta",\n  "source": "ripe",\n  "session_id": "ca128382-78d9-41d1-8927-1ecef15275be",\n  "version": 3\n}\n{\n  "action": "delete",\n  "object_class":

2001:db8::/32\\norigin: as65530\\nsource: ripe"\n}\n\n\n\n# key configuration\n\nto enable nrtmv4 we generate and configure a private ed25519 key and provide the corresponding public key, the irr database name, and the publication url of the update notification file. the public key is base64 encoded. the key is available in the next_signing_key attribute in the notification file.\n\nwe provide the public key file on a separate server.\n\nenvironment   public key url\nprod          https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/nrtmv4/nrtmv4_public_key.txt\nrc            https://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/nrtmv4/nrtmv4_public_key_rc.txt\n\n\n# key rotation\n\nthe public key will rotate approximately once a year for security reasons. the process for in-band key rotation involves:\n\n 1. generating and configuring a new key as the upcoming signing key.\n 2. including this key in the next_signing_key field of the update notification file, which propagates to mirror clients within 24 hours.\n 3. optionally refreshing the notification update file earlier.\n 4. mirror clients store the new key from the next_signing_key field upon retrieving the update notification file.\n 5. after a week, the server operator makes the new key active and removes the old key. future notification files will be signed with the new key and will not include a next_signing_key field.\n 6. if a client\'s signature validation fails, it must attempt to verify using the previously encountered next_signing_key and update its configuration if successful.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# setup ripe database mirror\n\nthere are three ways to set up a mirror of the ripe database.\n\n 1. using grs import.\n    \n    the grs import method is updated once per day.\n    \n    * first follow the whois installation instructions, to have a working whois installation.\n    \n    * create a local database, and a whois_mirror_ripe_grs database, and create tables in both using the whois_schema.sql script.\n    \n    * the local database will be used for any local changes.\n    \n    * the whois_mirror_ripe_grs database will be used for the mirror data.\n    \n    * configure the properties file as follows (you will need to customise the example whois.properties):\n    \n      whois.source=local\n      ...\n      grs.sources=ripe-grs\n      grs.sources.dummify=\n      ...\n      grs.import.sources=ripe-grs\n      grs.import.enabled=true\n      ...\n

whois.db.grs.slave.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/whois_mirror\n      ...\n    \n    \n    start whois, using the next command. use -ddump.total.size.limit to specify the dump size:\n    \n    /usr/bin/java -dwhois -djsse.enablesniextension=false -dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -dhazelcast.jmx=true -dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099

automatically every midnight. or, connect to the process using jmx, and start the grs import.\n    \n      $ java --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=all-unnamed -jar jmxterm-<version>-uber.jar -v verbose\n      >    open <pid>\n      >    bean net.ripe.db.whois:name=grsimport\n      >    run grsimport "ripe-grs" "test"\n      #calling operation grsimport of mbean net.ripe.db.whois:name=grsimport\n      #operation returns:\n      grs import started\n    \n    \n    * monitor progress by checking the log4j console output, the import will take around 2 hours to complete.\n    \n    * you can query for objects in the mirror using for example:\n      \n        -s ripe-grs 82.185.158.240 - 82.185.158.247\n        --resource 82.185.158.240 - 82.185.158.247\n      \n\n 2. using bootstrap and nrtmv3.\n    \n    with this method the mirror database gets updated in near real time.\n    \n    this page describes the process of loading the empty mirror database with a nightly export of the ripe database.\n    \n    * first follow the whois installation instructions here, to have a working whois installation.\n    \n    * create a local database, and a whois_mirror_ripe_grs database, and create tables in both using the whois_schema.sql script.\n    \n    * download a snapshot of the ripe db here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.db.gz\n    \n    * save the serial number that corresponds to the above snapshot from here: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/dbase/ripe.currentserial\n    \n    * both snapshot and ripe.currentserial are updated every night.\n    \n    * if you want to use automatic updates using nrtm, the dump should be at most 2 weeks old.\n    \n    * configure the properties file as follows (you will need to customise the example whois.properties):\n      \n        whois.source=local\n        …\n        grs.sources=ripe-grs\n        grs.sources.dummify=\n        …\n        # grs source-specific properties to acquire dumps\n

whois.db.grs.master.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/whois_mirror\n        whois.db.grs.slave.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/whois_mirror\n      \n    \n    * start the whois server using the following command. use -ddump.total.size.limit to specify the dump size:\n      \n        /usr/bin/java -dwhois -djsse.enablesniextension=false -dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -dhazelcast.jmx=true

-dlog4j.configurationfile=file:log4j2.xml -jar whois.jar\n      \n    \n    * initiate the loading of the dump file using the bootstrap command from jmx. the import could take several hours.\n      \n        % java --add-exports jdk.jconsole/sun.tools.jconsole=all-unnamed -jar jmxterm-<version>-uber.jar -v verbose\n        > bean net.ripe.db.whois:name=bootstrap\n        > run loaddump initialimport <path to ripe.db.gz>\n      \n    \n    * when the import is finished exit the jmx console, and test that it worked by executing a query using telnet:\n      \n        % telnet localhost 1043\n        > 193.0.0.1 - 193.0.7.255\n      \n    \n    the above jmx call will load the local database with the snapshot of the objects from the ftp dump.\n    \n    * now you need to stop the server and copy the local database to whois_mirror_ripe_grs.\n      \n        % kill <pid>\n        % mysqldump -udbint -p  local > local.sql\n        % mysql -udbint -p whois_mirror_ripe_grs < local.sql\n      \n    \n    * the above steps are important because you cannot mirror a remote database directly to the main source (local), and also you cannot load directly with the jmx call an ftp dump to the mirrored database.\n    \n    * the mirrored content has to be persisted to whois_mirror_grs.source, in our case whois_mirror_ripe_grs.\n    \n    * note that the properties:\n      \n        whois.db.grs.master.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/whois_mirror\n        whois.db.grs.slave.baseurl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost/whois_mirror\n      \n    \n    have to be like that, because they are dynamically suffixed by the grs.sources (ripe-grs)\n    \n    * start the server and check that the mirrored source is working:\n    \n       % /usr/bin/java -dwhois -djsse.enablesniextension=false

193.0.7.255\n    \n    \n    * if the query is successful, we can proceed with setup automatic updating with nrtmv3.\n\na server with 16gb ram, 8 gb swap, and 160gb disk space is recommended for mirroring. please note that running your own mirror is not supported!\n\n 3. using irrd with nrtmv4.\n    \n    this feature is in development and is subject to change.\n    \n    with this method the mirror database gets updated in near real time.\n    \n    this section outline the essential steps for configuring, initializing, and maintaining synchronisation using snapshot files and delta files. by following these protocols, mirror clients ensure accurate and timely updates of ripe database information, while maintaining security and integrity through cryptographic verification processes.\n    \n    * install irrd.\n    * configure irrd for nrtmv4: modify your irrd configuration to enable support for nrtmv4. this typically involves configuring the urls for snapshot files, delta files, and the update notification file. ensure that irrd is set up to server these files over https.\n    \n    # nrtmv4 specific settings for the ripe database\n    nrtm:\n       version: 4  # nrtmv4 version\n       url:\n          snapshot: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/ripe/nrtm-snapshot  # url for snapshot files\n          deltas: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/ripe/nrtm-deltas      # url for delta files\n          update_notification: https://nrtm.db.ripe.net/nrtmv4/ripe/update-notification-file.json  # url for update notification file\n       keys:\n          public:

not case-sensitive, but the software converts them all to lower case. the attribute name must start at column 0 and must immediately be followed by a colon (:). no spaces or tabs are allowed anywhere within the name, before the name, or in-between the attribute name and the colon. for example, the below notation is correct: mntner: test-dbm-mnt this is correct because there is no space between the colon (:) and the attribute name (mntner).\n\nthe software is very strict on these points, but they are common user mistakes. there are many aspects to the formatting of attributes and values and the relationship between them. it is not easy to change just one element of this formatting.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# attribute properties\n\nattributes can be used in different ways in different objects. currently, there are three properties that apply to all attributes:\n\n * presence\n * repeat\n * indexed\n\nthe allowed attributes for any object type are shown in the object templates (see the section \'rpsl object types\').\n\n\n# presence\n\nnot all allowed attributes need to be present in every instance of the object type. the table below shows how presence is defined for an attribute. the same attribute name may have a different presence defined in different object types. for example "status:" is mandatory in an inetnum object, but generated in an aut-num object.\n\ntypes of ‘presence\' of an attribute\n\ntype          description\n[mandatory]   you must include at least one instance of this attribute in\n              all objects of this type.\n[optional]    this attribute is optional in the objects of this type and\n              you can leave it out. if you choose to include this\n              attribute then the value must also be included.\n[required]    the syntax rules define this attribute as optional. however,\n              additional business rules require this attribute under some\n              circumstances.\n[generated]   these attributes are generated if you leave them out. if you\n              include the attribute and provide the value, it may be\n              replaced by a value determined by the software.\n\n\n# repeat\n\nattributes can have single or multiple values. note that it is the value that matters more than the attribute here. an attribute can only take a comma-separated list of values if it is defined as multiple.\n\nfor an attribute defined as single in an object template, there can only be one instance of this attribute in an object of that type and it can only have a single value (even if this attribute is defined as being able to have a list of values).\n\nfor an attribute defined as multiple in an object template, there can be many instances of this attribute in an object of that type. if any of these attributes can have a list of values then it is allowed for multiple attributes.\n\nthere is no limit on the number of times a multiple attribute can be added to an object. but there is an overall limit on the size of an object.\n\ntype         description\n[single]     objects can only contain one instance of this\n             ‘attribute–value\' pair.\n[multiple]   objects may contain more than one instance of this\n             attribute. for some attributes, an instance may contain a\n             list of values, separated by commas.\n\n\n# indexed\n\nmany attribute values are indexed within the database. this is necessary to provide fast, efficient lookups of data. all objects\' primary keys are indexed. these and any other indexed value may be used to do standard lookups or reverse lookups.\n\na standard lookup is where you look for an object that contains the specified value. where this value can be found in an object depends on the index tables built with that attribute value.\n\nan inverse lookup is where you look for objects that contain the specified value in the list of specified attribute types. (see more about indexed searches in the section on querying the ripe database.)\n\nwhois –i mnt-by,mnt-lower,mnt-routes: aardvark-mnt\n\n\nindexes are built internally within the database. this property does not affect nor put any restrictions on the data entered by a user.\n\ntable 3.5 types of ‘indexes\' of an attribute\n\ntype            description\n[lookup key]    this attribute is indexed.\n[inverse key]   this attribute is in the "reverse" index.\n[primary key]   this attribute is (part of) the primary key for this object\n                type.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# attribute values\n\nthe value part of the attribute-value pair starts after the colon (:). it can immediately follow the colon, or spaces or tabs may be used to separate them. the format and content of a value is determined by the syntax definition for that attribute within that object type. the same attribute name may be used in more than one object type. often, the syntax definition will be the same for an attribute regardless of which object type it is used in. for example, the "admin-c:" attribute appears in most object types with the same definition of its syntax. but sometimes the attribute may be defined in a different way in different object types. for example "status:" is used in inetnum, inet6num and aut-num objects. for each of these object types, "status:" has a different meaning with a different pre-defined set of values.\n\nthe value can contain some pre-defined keywords at any place within the value as determined by the syntax definition for that attribute within that object type. it can also contain references to other objects and free text. you can refer to other objects by using their primary key values. these references and the keywords have a precisely defined syntax. if the objects you refer to do not already exist in the database, you will see error messages and your update will fail. the free text has no syntax, but may only contain latin-1 recognisable characters.\n\nsome attribute values may contain spaces and tab characters to help make the information easier to read, as long as the syntax definition allows it. note that spaces work better than tabs, as tabs can display differently on different machines.\n\nif an attribute is included in an object, it must have a value unless the value is defined as free text. even generated attributes, if included in the object, must have a syntactically valid value. the software may change this value, however, if the value is missing there will be a syntax error.\n\n\n# split values\n\nin most cases, a value can be split over multiple lines. each continuation line must start with a space, tab or plus (+) in column zero. continuation lines do not include the attribute name.\n\nan object cannot have a blank line inside it because this would mark the end of the object. a blank continuation line must start with the ‘+\' sign in column zero.\n\nan example of a correct continuation line:\n\naddress:  singel 258\n+\n      amsterdam \n\n\nnote the ‘+\' in column zero on the second, blank line.\n\nvalues cannot be split in the first attribute, which defines the object type, or in the primary key attribute(s). if this is done, the software will re-combine these attributes into a single-line value. the update will not fail.\n\nwhen parsing an object, the software will internally recombine continuation line values into a single value for processing. the values from multiple lines are joined with a single space in-between them. therefore, it is also not possible to split a value in the middle of a word or within any text string. the object is stored in the database with any valid split values.\n\n\n# end-of-line comments\n\nin most cases, an end of line comment can be added at the end of a value. these start with a hash (#) and continue until the end of the physical line (a newline character ‘\\n\'). if a value is split over several lines, any or all of the lines may include an end of line comment. you cannot continue the comment on another line- these comments always stop at the end of the line in which they start. an end of line comment cannot start at column 0. it is possible to add end of line comments on several consecutive lines, which together form a block of text. however, for long comments, it is better to use the "remarks:" attribute.\n\nadmin-c: dw-ripe  # these nic handles\ntech-c:  dw-ripe  # form a set of contacts\nzone-c:  dw-ripe  # for this object\n\n\nany free form value cannot contain a hash (#) character, as this would be recognised as the start of a comment. although the software does not process comments, in some situations it does strip off the comments before using the values.\n\nif split values and end of line comments are used together, the software strips off the end of line comments before the split values are combined.\n\nend of line comments cannot be added to the first attribute value, which defines the object type, or to the primary key attribute(s) value. if this is done the software will strip them off. the update will not fail. these comments are also not allowed on the "source:" attribute value. if one is added here, the update will fail.\n\nlong, end of line comments or long, free form attribute values can cause problems. some email clients automatically break lines at certain points. if your email client does this on an update message then your update will fail. it may not be obvious at first sight that this has happened. fortunately, there are many other options for submitting updates if this problem occurs.\n\n\n# list values\n\nsome attributes allow the value to be a list. this must be a comma-separated list with no spaces allowed. these attributes can be viewed in the appendix.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# attributes in an object\n\nthe first attribute must have the same name as the object type. this identifies the object type. the currently available object types are shown in the sub-sections, \'list of primary objects\' and \'list of secondary objects\'. if the type is not recognised, that part of an update message will be seen as a paragraph of text and will be disregarded with an appropriate error message. if the unrecognised type is in a query, it will be rejected with an error.\n\nother attributes can appear in any order, but most people stick to the order as shown in the object templates (see the section \'rpsl object types\'). each object type is defined to have a set of possible attributes. the set for each object type is defined within the software and shown in the template.\n\neach instance of an object type is uniquely defined by a primary key. for most object types, the primary key is normally the value of the first attribute. in some cases, it is a different attribute value or a composite of more than one attribute value. the primary key only has to be unique within an object type. objects of different types can sometimes have the same primary key, as long as the key fits the syntax for both object types. for example ‘fred\' is a valid name for a mntner object. ‘fred\' is also a valid "nic-hdl:" value, which is the primary key for a person or role object.\n\neach attribute name must start on a separate line. however, not every line needs an attribute as values can continue over several lines. a blank line marks the end of an object . technically this is two consecutive newline characters, \\n\\n. for this reason, you cannot include a completely blank line in the middle of an object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# database objects\n\nthe ripe database contains records of:\n\n * allocations and assignments of ip address space (the ip address registry or inr);\n * reverse domain registrations;\n * routing policy information (the internet routing registry or irr);\n * contact information (details of people who are registered as contacts for the internet resources used in the operation of networks or routers, and their organisations).\n\nthe records in the ripe database are known as ‘objects\'. routing policy specification language (rpsl) defines the basic syntax of database objects. for further information see rfc 2622. but, over the years, practical operations have resulted in a number of deviations from the basic rpsl definition. many extensions have also been made to the ripe implementation of rpsl for the ripe database. some features of rpsl were never implemented and others have been removed as requirements changed. for engineering-minded people, these database objects (records) should not be confused with the objects used in object-orientated programming languages that are used to write the software.\n\nthere are many types of objects in the database. these are described in the section: \'rpsl object types\'. objects contain a piece of information relating to an internet resource or a supporting or administrative function. objects can reference other objects and these references must be followed to obtain the full description of an internet resource. inheritance is not used, which means that some references must be duplicated across large numbers of objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# how to organize your data\n\nthere are many different types of objects in the ripe database. some of them can be used in different ways. how you use them makes a big difference to the workload needed to maintain the data.\n\nthe ripe database is intended for those who have, or will soon have internet resources. this database is a public registry with a well-defined purpose. see \'purpose of the ripe database\' for more details. you can create many objects in the ripe database without any resources. but if these objects are not referenced by any resource object within a specified time period they will all be deleted. see the section on garbage collection for more details.\n\nresource holders using the ripe database need a basic set of objects:\n\n * organisation\n * role\n * person\n * mntner\n\nfor new members, this set of objects will be set up by the ripe ncc as part of the new lir process. how you use these objects will affect how much maintenance you need to perform later.\n\n\n# using the organisation object\n\nthe organisation object was introduced in 2004, long after the ripe database data model was designed. the organisation object can make life easier in some situations.\n\nconsider all users as organisations, whether they are multinational companies, universities or individuals. to use the ripe database, each of these organisations needs a set of data objects that represent their business model. the organisation must have:\n\n 1. people who can be contacted\n 2. these people have defined roles in the business\n 3. these roles include responsibility for internet resources\n 4. these resources need authorisation tokens to protect them\n 5. these tokens may need public keys.\n\nthis set of objects represents your organisation. when the organisation is an individual who has been assigned some pi space, they may need several objects in the database. multinational companies may have many hundreds of thousands of objects.\n\nthe organisation object was introduced as a way of keeping track of these sets of objects. the idea is to put the organisational identity of the entity at the centre by defining its organisation object. the organisation\'s business model can then be mapped out by creating the objects from the list above as appropriate. each of these objects can be directly linked to the organisation object using the "org:" attribute. or for a simplified model, link the mntner objects using the "org:" attribute in each mntner object. all objects must be maintained, so there is an indirect reference back to the organisation object through the mntner objects.\n\nsome multinational companies may have a distributed business model with different parts of the organisation responsible for different parts of their network. in this situation additional organisation objects can be created. these objects can reference the main organisation object through their own "org:" attribute. this allows users to keep track of the entire company\'s data or the parts delegated to different sections of the company.\n\nby using these "org:" references, bulk changes to data are very much simplified. tools can be written and deployed more easily. new ideas can be rolled out quickly across an entire data set. the more structured you make your data, the more easily it is to automate processes.\n\nwhen the organisation object was first introduced there was some resistance to make references to it for fear of the public or competitors being able to map out their business. but now that there are so many ways to (inverse) query the data, it is not difficult to find all resources or customers of any organisation. if you don\'t set up your data in a structured way, the management of the data becomes more complicated.\n\nbasically the organisation object should be the centre of your presence in the ripe database. all your human resources and internet resources and authentication tokens should hang off this central point.\n\n\n# using the role object\n\nthe person and role objects are often said to be interchangeable:\n\n * they share the same name space in the ripe database, but names can be duplicated.\n * the nic handles are only unique across the two object types combined, so both object types can\'t exist with the same nic handle.\n * either a role or person object can be used everywhere that requires a reference to a contact, with only a couple of exceptions where it must be one type or the other.\n\nhowever, these two objects have very different functions. a person object holds personal details about an individual. a role object should describe a business function or operational unit and may reference the individual people responsible for this activity. references to person objects are optional in the role object.\n\nusing role objects makes large-scale changes easier. the principle is the same if you have ten objects or 10,000 objects in the database. however, problems most commonly occur when dealing with a very large number of objects.\n\nmany organisations create a large number of objects that directly reference a person object, and experience difficulties if this person leaves the company. the organisation may be responsible for many objects of different types, possibly with several different mntner objects protecting them, and finding them and getting all the authorisations right to change the references can easily become a problem.\n\nworking within certain guidelines can help avoid this situation:\n\nonly use a person object as a holder of personal information only reference a person object in role objects reference the role objects in all the other places where contact data is required if the person responsible for a business role or function changes, then it is only necessary to modify a few role objects to reference a different person object. all references to the role objects remain valid. the scale of the changes you need to make is very much reduced.\n\neven if you have only a handful of objects in the database, it is good practice to do this. your business may grow, and time restraints mean that you may not go back and change things until you absolutely have to do so. this is how these objects were designed for use, but as this practice was never enforced by software business rules, much of the database still makes direct references to person objects.\n\n\n# abuse details\n\nthe irt object (internet response team) was introduced to identify a computer security incident response team (csirt) for handling serious network problems like dos attacks. it was later modified to make it usable for more general abuse. but all the old ways of documenting abuse were also still available. now with the introduction of "abuse-c:" this general abuse is moving away from the irt object again. after a data cleanup, the irt object will only be used for csirt teams again and should not be used to handle general abuse complaints.\n\ngeneral abuse is now handled by the organisation object. this should reference an abuse handling role object with an "abuse-c:" attribute. this role object must include an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. all ripe ncc allocated address space and direct end user assignments, represented by inet(6)num and aut-num objects, should reference an organisation object directly. all more specific address space objects inherit this reference. the abuse handler for this address space and all the more specific address space to that specified by the inet(6)num object is determined by the referenced organisation object.\n\nthere is a query flag (-c) which will return the irt object, if one exists, for any specified inet(6)num object. there is also another query flag (-b) that will find the indirectly referenced role object, extract the "abuse-mailbox:" attribute and return brief details including the email address from the role object.\n\n\n# who maintains the data?\n\nthis is one of those areas that some users don\'t pay much attention to, but it is one of the most important questions regarding the use of the ripe database. anyone authorised to maintain your data can cause serious damage to your network, your business and the business of your customers if they make a mistake. authorisation is an all or nothing concept. you cannot authorise someone to create and modify customer\'s details but not delete it, for example.\n\nfor details of the technical workings of authorisation see the section, \'authorisation\'. this section is about how to set up who can authorise what.\n\nthe authorisation model is based on the mntner object. this is a box that holds credentials. there are different types of credentials with passwords, pgp certificates and single sign-on (sso) usernames being the main ones. at the time of writing, these credentials don\'t need to match anyone who is registered in the ripe database with a person object. they are simply lists of credentials that can belong to anyone. it is therefore not possible for the database software to identify ‘who\' authorised an update. the introduction of sso as a credential is a step in this direction.\n\nevery object in the ripe database must now be protected by a mntner object referenced by a "mnt-by:" attribute. the mntner object is also protected by a "mnt-by:" attribute. normally, this references itself.\n\nfor a small organisation with only a few objects in the database you may decide that you only need one mntner object. this is created with one or more credentials and maintains itself. every object you create in the ripe database is maintained by this mntner object. the people whose credentials are in the mntner object all have equal and full control over all of your database objects. they can create, modify and delete anything. because of the anonymous way credentials are used in the mntner object, the software cannot identify which credential made the update, only that a specific mntner object was used.\n\nfor larger organisations with potentially hundreds of thousands of objects in the database you may want to distribute authority to maintain data. how you distribute it depends on your business model. one example could be for a multi-national organisation with customers in different countries to partition your address space allocations by country. you could have a separate team managing the network in each country, each with their own mntner object. the "mnt-lower:" attribute on the partitioned allocations restricts control to those teams.\n\nanother possibility is to have separate teams handling address space, reverse delegations and routing. this can be set up using the appropriate "mnt-xxx:" attributes. for example "mnt-routes:".\n\nyou may also want to control who can grant authority to manage your data. normally a mntner object maintains itself. this means anyone who has a credential in that mntner object can also change the mntner object. so they can add another password so that another person can make changes. in a large organisation, you may want a security team to control the mntner objects. in this case you can create a mntner object for the security team. all other mntner objects are maintained by this security team mntner. only the security team can then allow someone else authority to maintain some data by adding their credential to the appropriate mntner object.\n\n\n# how do i keep an audit trail of changes to my data?\n\nyou can use notifications to keep track of changes to your data. this section details how to set up who gets notified of what.\n\nthe \'notifications\' section details the technical workings of notifications and how to set up who gets notified of what.\n\nthere are many ways to set up notifications. if you want to know everything, you should use the mntner objects. all of your data is maintained by one or more mntner objects. these objects have a mandatory attribute "upd-to:". this lets you know if someone is trying to hack into your data. any update to objects maintained by this mntner object that fails on authorisation gets notified to this email address. there is also an optional attribute "mnt-nfy" in the mntner object. this notifies you of every successful update to any object maintained by this mntner object.\n\nmost people direct notifications to individuals in the organisation, which is adequate if those individuals want to know about changes to objects they have some responsibility for, or interest in. however, these emails are often missed, ignored or simply deleted. if there is an issue that results from a change made some time ago, the information you received about the change may have been lost.\n\none way to keep an audit trail of changes is to set up a specific email address that you can reference in all of your mntner objects, in both email attribute types. you can set up a script that monitors that email address and archives all emails to a log file or database. you then have an audit trail of changes made to your objects. one thing that is missing is the acknowledgement message. for email updates, this is only returned to the address that submits the update. for web form updates or restful api updates, there is no acknowledgement message sent anywhere. the response is returned to the web session. however, for all updates, the software still generates the human-readable acknowledgement message that is returned in response to an email update. this is logged internally in the ripe ncc\'s update logs, but only sent to the user if the update was submitted by email. without a copy of this acknowledgement message, it is not possible to have a complete audit trail of who did what and when they did it.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# list of primary objects\n\nthese are the currently supported objects in the ripe database that are considered to be primary data.\n\nobject type

and secondary.\n\nprimary objects contain operational data. for example inetnum and aut-num objects hold internet resource information. also, route and domain objects hold details of routing agreements and reverse delegations.\n\nsecondary objects provide supporting and administrative details for primary objects. for example, person objects hold contact information for someone related to

in plain text. these ‘attribute-value\' pairs can take different forms. attributes are sometimes referred to as ‘keys\'.\n\nall the database content is currently in latin-1 encoding. any characters not in latin-1 is automatically converted to latin-1. any characters without an equivalent in latin-1 are substituted with a question mark character. one exception is that idn domain names in email address attributes are automatically converted to punycode.\n\nwhen an object is stored in the database, the full text supplied by the user is stored as a single item as close as possible to what the user supplied. this means that the attributes and values are almost unchanged and the order is maintained. the spacing between the attributes and values may be adjusted to align the values and make them easier to read. parts of the object are also extracted from the text and stored in separate tables and indexes along with some generated metadata to help with database functionality.\n\nthis is a list of changes that are made to the data supplied by the user:\n\n * generate or change supplied values for generated attributes\n * add missing "status:" to an aut-num object with generated value\n * set/reset "status:" to \'legacy\' on more specific objects to a legacy object\n * change all attribute names to lower case\n * change source value to upper case\n * remove a trailing dot on reverse domain keys\n * remove tabs and excess spaces from inetnum ranges and inet(6)num status values\n * remove leading zeroes from inetnum ranges\n * convert inetnum prefix value to a range\n * convert inet6num values to canonical format\n * remove end of line comments from primary and type attributes\n * join up split values in primary and type attributes\n\nin some cases an information message is added to the acknowledgement sent back to the user making the update. for example:\n\n***info:    value 193.in-addr.arpa. converted to 193.in-addr.arpa\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# rpsl object types\n\nin this section, the many types of objects in the ripe database are described. objects contain a piece of information relating to an internet resource or a supporting or administrative function.\n\nfor each object, a template shows which attributes are allowed for this type. the properties of the attributes are also shown, as they apply to the attributes within this object type. following the template, some description is included about the definition and use of the included attributes.\n\nin the object templates, required attributes are shown as ‘optional*\'. this is because the concept of ‘required\' was added long after the data model and syntax mechanism was designed. it is handled at a later stage by applying business rules built into the software. these templates are used by the software to apply syntax checks. we don\'t want to document them in a way that is significantly different to the way the software applies them. we want to make it clear that there is a difference between purely ‘optional\' and ‘required\'.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# description of attributes common to all objects\n\n * "org:" – this optional attribute references the primary key, or id, of an organisation object that currently exists in the database. the referenced object contains details of the organisation that holds internet resources or secondary objects to help manage resources in the ripe database or specifies business relations. this attribute is required on the inet(6)num objects with the following status values:\n   \n   * allocated-by-rir\n   * allocated pa\n   * allocated-assigned pa\n   * allocated pi\n   * allocated unespecified\n\n * "admin-c:" – this attribute is optional in some objects and mandatory in others. it references the primary key, or nic handle, of either a role or person object. it should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object. the reference must be the contact details of an on-site administrative contact. this contact may be a single person, or it may be a role within the organisation that more than one person takes on. these people may or may not be listed in the role object.\n\n * "tech-c:" – this attribute is optional in some objects and mandatory in others. it references the primary key, or nic handle, of either a role or person object. it should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object. the reference must be the contact details of a technical contact. this contact may be a single person, or it may be a role within the organisation that more than one person takes on. these people may or may not be listed in the role object.\n\n * "remarks:" – this optional attribute can be any free format text, within the allowable encoding. this attribute can even have a blank value and be used as a spacer to separate different parts of the information in an object. some objects have very complex arrangements in their remarks with lots of formatting and style to create a layout that almost personalises their data. keep in mind that it is data and the ripe database is not the best place to display ascii art. the best advice on using remarks is to ‘keep it simple\'.\n\n * "notify:" – this optional attribute specifies an email address to which notifications of changes to an object will be sent. only the email addresses from the "notify:" attribute values contained in ‘this\' object will be notified of changes to ‘this\' object. only successful changes will be notified. within the ripe ncc, we can override this notification mechanism. for example, if the community agrees on a syntax change that affects many objects in the database, this change may be done as a bulk update by the ripe ncc. in some cases, the ripe ncc does not want to trigger hundreds of thousands or even millions of emails to be sent as part of the implementation of an agreed change.\n\n * "mnt-by:" – this mandatory attribute references the primary key, or name, of a mntner object that currently exists in the database. this mntner object\'s credentials must authorise any operations performed on the object that contains this attribute. the mntner object must exist in the database before it can be referenced in other objects. in some objects, the mntner object referenced in a "mnt-by:" attribute can have a range of additional powers. this is explained in more detail in the section \'authorisation\'. when this applies, it will be stated in the object template descriptions.\n\n * "created:" – this attribute reflects when the object was created in the ripe database. because a large number of objects were imported in bulk from a previous incarnation of the ripe database on 21 september 2001, the actual "created" time for these objects can be very difficult or impossible to find. because iso 8601 does not support an "undefined" notation, the following date and time is used: 1970-01-01t00:00:00z\n\n * "last-modified:" – this attribute reflects when it was last changed. if an object has never been changed, the value of this attribute will be the same as the "created:" attribute. if an object was part of the bulk import on 21 september 2001 and has never been modified, the original import date and time was used for this attribute. this attribute will not be modified as a result of bulk changes, applied to the database by the ripe ncc, that have no semantic meaning. an example of this is when an attribute is deprecated and removed from all objects containing it.\n\n * "source:" – the "source:" attribute should specify the authoritative registry where the object is registered. in the ripe database, all source values are set to ‘ripe\'. the same value is used even when the object is a copy of a resource from another registry. the source may be appended with a software-generated end-of-line comment ‘# filtered\'. this is not part of the stored data. it may be generated when the object is displayed, depending on the query flags used. (note that users cannot add end-of-line comments to a source attribute. please see \'end of line comments\' for more information.) for the ripe test database the source value is ‘test\' for all objects. this may also be appended with ‘# filtered\'. for the global resource service (grs), the ripe ncc mirrors several other resource databases. the source value reflects which of the mirrored databases returned the query result. for example ‘apnic-grs\' if the queried resource was found in the mirror of the apnic database.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# descriptions of

possible attributes that are allowed in this object type. required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nattribute name   presence   repeat     indexed \naut-num:         mandatory  single

\n\n\nthe aut-num object serves a dual purpose in the database. as part of the ripe internet number registry, it contains the registration details of an autonomous system number (asn) resource assigned by the ripe ncc. as part of an internet routing registry, it allows routing policies to be published. it refers to a group of ip networks that have a single and clearly defined external routing policy, operated by one or more network operators – an autonomous system (as). this is the only primary object that crosses over between these two registries in the ripe database.\n\nbecause of this crossover between the two registries contained within the ripe database, authorisation for creation of route(6) objects can and must be provided by both the address space holder and the holder of the as number. for more details, see the section \'authorisation\'.\n\nthe number part of an asn is a 32-bit number. historically, these were 16-bit numbers. but when the pool of available numbers was running low, they were extended to 32 bits. in theory, there is no difference between a 16-bit asn and a 32-bit asn, except perhaps the size of the number. one is just a subset of the other. for technical reasons, some users still prefer a 16-bit asn.\n\nthe primary key value will be in this format:\n\n‘asn\' where ‘n\' is a 32-bit unsigned, number in the range 0: 4,294,967,295.\n\nleading zeroes (as065536) are not allowed and will be removed (as65536) by the database software.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the aut-num object\n\n * "aut-num:" – the registered as number of the autonomous system (as) that this object describes. it must start with the two letters ‘as\'.\n * "as-name:" – a symbolic name of the as. must be a single word of letters, numbers and the characters ‘-‘ and ‘_\'.\n * "descr:" - a short description related to the object.\n * "member-of:" - references a set object that this as wants to be a member of. this membership claim must be acknowledged by a respective "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * "import:", "export:" and "default:" - specify the ipv4 routing policies of the as.\n * "import-via:" and "export-via:" - specify routing policies regarding non-adjacent networks. these attributes help participants of multi-lateral peering services to inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be applied towards other participants.\n * "mp-import:", "mp-export:" and "mp-default:" - specify ipv4, ipv6 and multicast routing policies.\n * "org:" – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. this is a required attribute in the aut-num object. if the "status:" value is ‘assigned\' then the object must have an "org:" attribute.\n * "sponsoring-org:" – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. this value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. if a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. the aut-num object in the ripe database will then be synchronised with the changes. a user cannot set, remove or change this value. an aut-num object can be created without this attribute. but the ripe ncc can remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * "status:" – there are three different categories of aut-num objects in the ripe database. this generated "status:" attribute clearly shows which category an aut-num object belongs to. the categories are:\n   * ‘assigned\', - all as number resources assigned by the ripe ncc\n   * ‘legacy\' - all legacy as numbers used within the ripe region but not assigned by the ripe ncc\n   * ‘other\' – any aut-num that is not one of the above, typically a non-authoritative copy of an aut-num from another rir region used for routing authentication in the ripe database a user cannot set, remove or change this value. it is determined from the status noted for this resource in the registry information and set by the software when the object is updated. an update to an aut-num object will never fail because of a missing "status:" attribute or incorrect value. the software will add or correct it. the status of an aut-num is only administrative. it does not affect the usage of an aut-num for any routing purpose or impact certification in any way.\n * “abuse-c:” – this attribute references an abuse contact object. if present, this overrides any existing reference on a referenced organisation object. this can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “mnt-by:” – this attribute may have extra powers in addition to its default behaviour. in the absence of any “mnt-routes:” attributes, the mntner objects listed in the “mnt-by:” attributes can authorise the creation of route(6) objects originated by this as number. for more details, see the section \'authorisation\'.\n\n\n# description of the domain object\n\nbelow is the object template for the domain object. it lists all possible attributes allowed in this object type.\n\nattribute name    presence       repeat       indexed\ndomain:           mandatory      single       primary/lookup\ndescr:            optional       multiple\norg:              optional       multiple

for registering reverse delegations (number-to-name translations) in both the ripe database and the dns zone files. the ripe database is used as the management database for producing the dns zones. no forward domain names are stored in the ripe database. iana provides information about forward domains.\n\nreverse dns delegations allow applications to map to a domain name from an ip address. reverse delegation is achieved by use of the special domain names in-addr.arpa (ipv4) and ip6.arpa (ipv6).\n\nthe domain object is also used for registering enum delegations using the domain name e164.arpa.\n\nfor ipv4 addresses, a dash is allowed in the fourth octet of the reverse address. this allows for reverse dns delegations for address space that doesn\'t fall on octet boundaries as specified in rfc 2317. a dash is not allowed in any other octet. for example:\n\nipv4 address range\n10.2.1.6 - 10.2.1.25\n\nreverse delegation\n6-25.1.2.10.in-addr.arpa\n\n\nthis is created in the ripe database as a single object, including the dash in the range. the dns provisioning software handles the dash notation and propagates this delegation to the zone file. the range 0-255 is a special case and is not allowed in the fourth octet. modification and deletion can be performed on this single object in the database. any change is propagated into the zone file by the dns provisioning software.\n\nreverse dns zones in the ripe database do not allow child objects. from a dns view, only the parent object is effective. business rules in the database software check for hierarchies when a reverse domain object is being created. if either a less or more specific domain object already exists, the creation of the new object is rejected.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the domain object\n\n * “domain:” - this is the reverse delegation address or range. it can be for ipv4 or ipv6 addresses or an enum phone number. if a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record.\n * “descr:” - a short description related to the object.\n * “zone-c:” - this attribute references the primary key, or nic handle, of either a role or person object. it should always reference a role object, except in the role object where it optionally references nested role objects or a person object.\n * “nserver:” - the "nserver:" attributes in each domain object define the officially delegated dns nameservers (the ‘ns\' in dns zone contents). if a trailing dot is included it will be removed from the stored record. the nameserver name can optionally be followed by an ipv4 or ipv6 address as a glue record.\n * “ds-rdata:” – this attribute holds information about a signed delegation record for dns security extensions (dnssec). in dnssec the delegation signer (ds) resource record is created from a dnskey resource record by comparing it with the public key. the parent publishes the ds resource record. the "ds-rdata:" attribute contains the rdata of the ds resource records related to the domain (as shown in the "domain:" attribute). ds-rdata: 64431 5 1 278bf194c29a812b33935bb2517e17d1486210fa the tools provided with bind (version 9.3.0 and later) will generate a "ds set" during signing. before an update, you can copy the ds rdata into the attributes.\n\n\n# description of the inet6num object\n\nbelow is the object template for the inet6num object.

assignments of ipv6 address space resources. this is one of the main elements of the ripe internet number registry.\n\nhierarchy of inet6num objects\n\nthe inet6num objects cover many different types of data in the ripe database. the policy on issuing ipv6 addresses in the ripe ncc service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses. this policy has changed a number of times over the years and some of the data in the ripe database was set up under previous policy conditions. the following paragraphs try to outline how this physical data in the ripe database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nthey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object ::/0. this root object is there for data management reasons. it does not mean the ripe ncc has any administrative authority over the whole ipv6 address space.\n\nthe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the blocks of address space that the ripe ncc is administratively responsible for. most allocations to members are from the placeholder objects. however, there are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object. all of these objects, from the root object down to and including the allocations to members, have the same status value of ‘allocated-by-rir\'. there are no differences in the status to distinguish between blocks allocated by iana to the ripe ncc and allocations made by the ripe ncc to members. for this you need to look at the “mnt-lower:”. for the blocks allocated by iana to the ripe ncc, the “mnt-lower:” has a ripe ncc mntner, or it has no “mnt-lower:” which defaults to the “mnt-by:”. for allocations made from these administrative blocks to members, the “mnt-lower:” has the member\'s mntner. some objects also include remarks highlighting that they are allocations from iana to the ripe ncc.\n\nripe ncc also makes assignments to end users and tld operators from the placeholder administrative objects. these are recognised by the “status:” and the “mnt-by:”. in most cases, these assignments will have the status ‘assigned pi\' or ‘assigned anycast\'. some of the earlier direct assignments still have the status ‘assigned\'. these can still be recognised, as they should have a ripe ncc mntner as one of the joint “mnt-by:” attributes.\n\nwithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. they all have a placeholder object as their parent. all of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inet6num object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nthe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. these are jointly managed by the ripe ncc and either the end user or the sponsoring organisation. the sponsoring organisation is a ripe ncc member who handles the end user\'s administration for this resource with the ripe ncc.\n\nan assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. there can be no more specific objects. for the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. all objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the ripe database by the member organisation, not by the ripe ncc.\n\nthe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or the member can create an aggregation object with part of the allocation. assignments of a fixed size will be made from this aggregation object. finally, any part of the address space may be assigned to an end user. again, the assignment is the lowest level, or an end point, for that part of the hierarchy. all of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the inet6num object\n\n * “inet6num:” – this specifies a block of ipv6 addresses that the inet6num object presents. the block may be one or more addresses. addresses can only be expressed in a prefix notation. the prefix is converted to a canonical format where necessary and an informational message will be returned to the user if this conversion is done. the format expresses addresses as a 128-bit number in hexadecimal groups of two bytes with colon separators between the groups . there is the possibility of using a shorthand notation for strings of consecutive zeros. leading zeros from any two-byte group will be removed by the software. in this case, an informational message will be returned to the user.\n * “netname:” – this is a name given to a range of ip address space. a netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. the first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. it is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n * “descr:” – a short description related to the object.\n * “country:” – this identifies a country using the iso 3166 2-letter country codes. it has never been specified what this country represents. it could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company, where the server centre is based, or the home of the end user. therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map ip addresses to countries.\n * "geofeed:" – contains a url referencing a csv file containing geolocation data for the resource. the geofeed format is defined in rfc 8805.\n * “geoloc:” – the geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. all more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “language:” – identifies the language as a two-letter code from the iso 639-1 language code list. all more specific objects to the inet6num object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n * “org:” – single valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. this is a required attribute. in some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. if the inet6num object is (jointly) maintained by the ripe ncc then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. if a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. the inet6num object in the ripe database will then be synchronised with the changes. a user cannot set, remove or change this value. an inet6num object can be created without this attribute. the software will generate the correct value if it is required. the ripe ncc will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n * “abuse-c:” – this attribute references an abuse contact object. if present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . this can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “status:” – the status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inet6num object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. it can not be changed after creating the object and it can take one of these values:\n   * allocated-by-rir – this is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the ripe ncc is administratively responsible and allocations made to members by the ripe ncc.\n   * allocated-by-lir – this is equivalent to the inetnum status ‘sub-allocated pa\'. a member can sub-allocate part of an allocation to another organisation. the other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. however, the ripe ncc member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if some parts of it have been sub-allocated to another organisation. provisions have been built in to the ripe database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space. within such allocation, it is still required to document assignments using the status "aggregated-by-lir" or "assigned". with the inet6num object there is no equivalent to the inetnum ‘lir-partitioned\' status values allowing partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * aggregated-by-lir – with ipv6, it is not necessary to document each individual end user assignment in the ripe database. if you have a group of end users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /56, then you can create a large, single block with this status. the “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the end user blocks. all assignments made from this block must have that size. it is possible to have two levels of ‘aggregated-by-lir\'. the "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inet6num object has been created.\n   * assigned – these are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an end user.\n   * assigned pi – these are assignments made by the ripe ncc directly to an end user. in most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the end user. the sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the ripe database for the end user.\n   * assigned anycast – this address space has been assigned for use in tld anycast networks.\n * “assignment-size:” – this specifies the common size of all individual assignments aggregated into one block with the status ‘aggregated-by-lir\'. this attribute is required to be present if the inet6num object has this status. the individual assignments do not need to be represented in the ripe database. but one or more assignments may be included if the member wishes to specify them for any reason. the maximum assignment size is 128.\n * “mnt-lower:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the inet6num with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. if there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. this is explained in more detail in the section \'authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-domains:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inet6num with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inet6num and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. this is explained in more detail in the section \'authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-routes:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route6 object creation. authorisation for route6 object creation is the most complex. this is explained in more detail in the section \'authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-irt:” – despite its name, this attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. it references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. these references apply in a hierarchical way. so where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inet6num object inherit the reference.\n\n\n# description of the inetnum object\n\nbelow is the object template for the inetnum object. it lists all possible attributes allowed in this object type. required attributes are shown as ‘mandatory\'.\n\nattribute name    presence   repeat     indexed\ninetnum:

address space resources. this is one of the main elements of the ripe internet number registry.\n\nhierarchy of inetnum objects\n\nthe inetnum objects cover many different types of data in the ripe database. the policy on issuing ipv4 addresses in the ripe ncc service region explains more about the process of allocating and assigning addresses within the region. this policy has changed many times over the years. some of the data in the ripe database was set up under previous policy conditions. the following paragraphs outline how this physical data in the ripe database is structured and how to make sense of it.\n\nthey are arranged in a hierarchical structure starting with a root object 0/0. this root object is there for data management reasons. it does not mean the ripe ncc has any administrative authority over the whole ipv4 address space.\n\nthe next level down in the hierarchy after the root object includes placeholder objects representing the /8 ranges of address space that the ripe ncc is administratively responsible for. there are also top-level legacy objects. these are outside the administrative control of the ripe ncc but still used by resource holders within the ripe ncc service region. these are generally smaller than a /8 but hierarchically on the same level. in other words, the root object is the parent of all the top-level legacy objects and these /8 placeholder objects. there may be other placeholder objects outside these /8 objects for historical reasons. these will be cleaned up at some point in the future. there are also some allocations to members that have no parent placeholder object.\n\nthe different types of data can be recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. the root object and all the placeholder objects will have a status ‘allocated unspecified\'. but some of the member allocations may also have this status. if it has this status and has a ripe ncc mntner as the “mnt-lower:”, then it is an administrative block. all the legacy objects will have the status ‘legacy\'.\n\nthe ripe ncc has directly issued address space to its members and end users from the placeholder administrative objects. again, these are recognised by the “status:” and “mnt-lower:” attribute values. most allocations to members have a status ‘allocated pa\'. but a few will also have the status ‘allocated unspecified\'. they will all have the members mntner as “mnt-lower:”. the assignments made by the ripe ncc will have a status ‘assigned pi\' or ‘assigned anycast\'. an allocation can also contain a single assignment with the same prefix length as the allocation, this combined object has the status \'allocated-assigned pa\'.\n\nwithin the hierarchy, these allocations and assignments made from the administrative blocks are on the same level. they all have the placeholder objects as their parent. all of these allocations and assignments are required to have a reference to an organisation object. although the “org:” attribute is syntactically optional in an inetnum object, this requirement is set by software business rules.\n\nthe member allocation objects are partly managed by the ripe ncc and partly by the member. because of this joint management, there are two maintainers on the object as the “mnt-by:” - these are the ripe ncc maintainer and the lir\'s default maintainer. if no default maintainer is present yet, the lir must select it on the lir portal account details page. after doing this, the default maintainer will be reflected on all existing and new objects that have joint responsibility. business rules determine which attributes can only be changed by the ripe ncc and which ones can be changed by the lir.\n\nthe same principle applies to the assignments made from these administrative blocks. these are jointly managed by the ripe ncc and either the end user or the sponsoring organisation. the sponsoring organisation is a ripe ncc member who handles the end user\'s administration for this resource with the ripe ncc.\n\nan assignment is the lowest level of the hierarchy. there can be no more specific objects. for the allocations, the hierarchy can continue down several levels of more specific objects. all objects more specific to the allocation are created and managed in the ripe database by the member organisation, not by the ripe ncc.\n\nthe allocation can be partitioned to match the member organisation\'s business structure, or part of it can be sub-allocated to another organisation. finally, any part of it may be assigned to an end user. again, the assignment is the lowest level or end point for that part of the hierarchy. all of these levels can be recognised by the status values.\n\nthe top-level legacy objects are also jointly managed by the resource holder and the ripe ncc. some values in these objects have business rules preventing the resource holder from changing the values. all other parts of the object can be edited in the same way as any other object. below the top-level legacy object, the resource holder can create as many levels of hierarchy as they wish. all the objects in this legacy hierarchy will have the same status value of ‘legacy\'. so it is not possible to identify, for example, sub-allocations or assignments in the legacy hierarchy by status.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the inetnum object\n\n * “inetnum:” – this specifies a range of ipv4 addresses that the inetnum object presents. the range may be one or more addresses.\n\naddresses can be expressed in either range or prefix notation. if prefix notation is used, the software will convert this to range notation and an informational message will be returned to the user. the end address must always be greater than or equal to the start address.\n\nthe range notation expresses addresses as 32-bit whole numbers in dotted quad notation. leading zeros from any quad will be removed by the software and an informational message will be returned to the user.\n\n * “netname:” – this is a name given to a range of ip address space. a netname is made up of letters, digits, the underscore character and the hyphen character. the first character of a name must be a letter, and the last character of a name must be a letter or a digit. it is recommended that the same netname be used for any set of assignment ranges used for a common purpose, such as a customer or service.\n\n * “descr:” - a short description related to the object.\n\n * “country:” – this identifies a country using the iso 3166-2 letter country codes. it has never been specified what this country represents. it could be the location of the head office of a multi-national company or where the server centre is based or the home of the end user. therefore, it cannot be used in any reliable way to map ip addresses to countries.\n\n * "geofeed:" - contains a url referencing a csv file containing geolocation data for the resource. the geofeed format is defined in rfc 8805.\n\n * “geoloc:” - the geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180]. all more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “language:” - identifies the language as a two-letter code from the iso 639-1 language code list. all more specific objects to the inetnum object containing this attribute inherit this data.\n\n * “org:” – single-valued to make sure that only one organisation is responsible for this resource. this is a required attribute. in some cases, there are business rules to ensure that it is present. if the inetnum object is (jointly) maintained by the ripe ncc then the object must have an “org:” attribute.\n\n * “sponsoring-org:” – references an organisation object representing the sponsoring organisation that is administratively responsible for the resource. this value is generated by the software and synchronised with the registry information. if a resource is no longer subject to a contract with the sponsoring organisation, or a contract is signed with a new sponsoring organisation, this will be updated in the registry information for this resource. the inetnum object in the ripe database will then be synchronised with the changes. a user cannot set, remove or change this value. an inetnum object can be created without this attribute. the software will generate the correct value if it is required. the ripe ncc will remove the attribute during a period in-between the ending of a contract with one sponsoring organisation and the signing of a contract with a new sponsoring organisation.\n\n * “abuse-c:” – this attribute references an abuse contact object. if present, this overrides any existing referenced organisation, or * "abuse-c:" attribute present in the hierarchy of this object . this can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n\n * “status:” – the status is used to show the different types of data stored in an inetnum object and the relative positions within a hierarchy. it can take one of these values:\n   \n   * ‘allocated unspecified\' – this is mostly used to identify blocks of addresses for which the ripe ncc is administratively responsible. historically, a small number of allocations made to members have this status also.\n   * ‘allocated pa\' – these are allocations made to members by the ripe ncc.\n   * \'allocated-assigned pa\' - an allocation with a single assignment of the same prefix length.\n   * aggregated-by-lir – it is not necessary to document each individual end user assignment in the ripe database. if you have a group of end users who all require blocks of addresses of the same size, say a /24, then you can create a large, single block with this status. the “assignment-size:” attribute specifies the size of the end user blocks. all assignments made from this block must have that size. it is possible to have two levels of ‘aggregated-by-lir\'. the "assignment-size" value cannot be changed after the inetnum object has been created.\n   * ‘lir-partitioned pa\' – this is to allow partitioning of an allocation by a member for internal business reasons.\n   * ‘sub-allocated pa\' – a member can sub-allocate a part of an allocation to another organisation. the other organisation may take over some of the management of this sub-allocation. however, the ripe ncc member is still responsible for the whole of their registered resources, even if parts of it have been sub-allocated. provisions have been built in to the ripe database software to ensure that the member is always technically in control of their allocated address space.\n   * ‘assigned pa\' – these are assignments made by a member from their allocations to an end user.\n   * ‘assigned pi\' – these are assignments made by the ripe ncc directly to an end user. in most cases, there is a member acting as the sponsoring organisation who handles the administrative processes on behalf of the end user. the sponsoring organisation may also manage the resource and related objects in the ripe database for the end user.\n   * ‘assigned anycast\' - this address space has been assigned for use in tld anycast networks.\n   * ‘legacy\' – these are resources that were allocated to users before the ripe ncc was set up.\n\n * “mnt-lower:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one-level more specific (child) objects to the inetnum with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. if there is no “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. this is explained in more detail in the section, \'authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-domains:” - this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for domain object creation for reverse delegation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the domain objects whose prefixes are contained within the range of addresses set by the inetnum with the “mnt-domains:” attribute. depending on the hierarchical relationship between the inetnum and domain objects, the “mnt-lower:” and “mnt-by:” attributes may also be used. this is explained in more detail in the section, \'authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-routes:” - this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for route object creation. authorisation for route object creation is the most complex. this is explained in more detail in the section, \'authorisation\'\n\n * “mnt-irt:” - this attribute is not a reference to a mntner object. it references an irt object, which is a contact data object, like the role object. authorisation is required from the irt object to be able to add this reference. these references apply in a hierarchical way. therefore, where an “irt:” attribute is included, all more specifics to that inetnum object inherit the reference. this is explained in more detail in the section on abuse handling.\n\n\n# description of the route

autonomous system can be specified by using a route object for ipv4 addresses.\n\nauthorisation for creating route objects is quite complex. there are multiple scenarios depending on who administers

using the as routing consistency tool. this wizard compares the actual state of the internet routing tables (collected by ris), in order to identify and correct possible inconsistencies in the ripe database.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the route object\n\n * “route:” – this specifies the ipv4 address prefix of the route. together with the "origin:" attribute, these constitute a combined primary key of the route object. the address can only be specified as a prefix. it can be one or more ip addresses.\n * “descr:” - a short description related to the object.\n * “origin:” - as number of the autonomous system that originates the route into the interas routing system. the corresponding aut-num object for this autonomous system may not exist in the ripe database.\n * “pingable:” - allows a network operator to advertise an ip address of a node that should be reachable from outside networks. this node can be used as a destination address for diagnostic tests. the ip address must be within the address range of the route object containing this attribute.\n * “ping-hdl:” - references a person or role capable of responding to queries concerning the ip address(es) specified in the \'pingable\' attribute.\n * “holes:” – these attributes form a list of the component address prefixes that are not reachable through the aggregate route (that part of the address space is possibly unallocated).\n * “member-of:” – this attribute identifies a set object that this route object wants to be a member of. this membership claim, however, should be acknowledged by a corresponding "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * “inject:” – these attributes specify which routers perform the aggregation and when they perform it.\n * “aggr-mtd:” – this attribute specifies how the aggregate is generated.\n * “aggr-bndry:” – this attribute defines a set of autonomous systems, which form the aggregation boundary.\n * “export-comps:” – this attribute defines the set\'s policy filter, a logical expression which, when applied to a set of routes, returns a subset of these routes.\n * “components:” – this attribute defines the component routes used to form the aggregate.\n * “mnt-lower:” - provides a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the route with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. this is only used if the parent route object does not contain an “mnt-routes:” attribute. if there is no “mnt-routes:” or “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. for more details see the section on authorisation.\n * “mnt-routes:” - provides a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for exact match or more specific route object creation. for an exact match route object- if there is no “mnt-routes:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” is used. for a more specific route object the “mnt-lower may also be used, if present. the "mnt-routes:" attribute can include an optional list of prefix ranges inside curly brackets ("{}") or the keyword "any". this should follow the reference to the maintainer. the default, when no additional set items are specified, is "any" or all more specifics.\n\n\n# description of the route6 object\n\nbelow is the object template for the route6 object. it

to the route6 object\n\n * “route6:” – this specifies the ipv6 address prefix of the route. together with the "origin:" attribute, these constitute a combined primary key of the route6 object. the address can only be specified as a prefix. it can be one or more addresses.\n * “descr:” - a short description related to the object.\n * “origin:” - as number of the autonomous system that originates the route into the interas routing system. the corresponding aut-num object for this as must already exist in the ripe database.\n * “pingable:” - allows a network operator to advertise an ip address of a node that should be reachable from outside networks. this node can be used as a destination address for diagnostic tests. the ip address must be within the address range of the route6 object containing this attribute.\n * “ping-hdl:” - references a person or role capable of responding to queries concerning the ip address(es) specified in the \'pingable\' attribute.\n * “holes:” – these attributes form a list of the component address prefixes that are not reachable through the aggregate route (that part of the address space is possibly unallocated).\n * “member-of:” – this attribute identifies a set object that this route6 object wants to be a member of. this membership claim, however, should be acknowledged by a corresponding "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n * “inject:” – these attributes specify which routers perform the aggregation and when they perform it.\n * “aggr-mtd:” – this attribute specifies how the aggregate is generated.\n * “aggr-bndry:” – this attribute defines a set of autonomous systems, which form the aggregation boundary.\n * “export-comps:” – this attribute defines the set\'s policy filter, a logical expression which when applied to a set of routes returns a subset of these routes.\n * “components:” – this attribute defines the component routes used to form the aggregate.\n * “mnt-lower:” - provides a set of authorisation tokens used for hierarchical object creation. these tokens are used to authorise the creation of the one level more specific (child) objects to the route6 with the “mnt-lower:” attribute. this is only used if the parent route6 object does not contain an “mnt-routes:” attribute. if there is no “mnt-routes:” or “mnt-lower:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” authorises the creation of the child objects. for more details see the section \'authorisation\'.\n * “mnt-routes:” - provides a set of authorisation tokens that may be used for exact match or more specific route6 object creation. for an exact match route6 object- if there is no “mnt-routes:” attribute, the “mnt-by:” is used. for a more specific route6 object- the “mnt-lower may also be used, if present. the "mnt-routes:" attribute can include an optional list of prefix ranges inside curly brackets ("{}") or the keyword "any". this should follow the reference to the maintainer. the default, when no additional set items are specified, is "any" or all more specifics.\n\n\n# description of the as-set object\n\nbelow is the object template for the as-set object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nattribute name  presence   repeat     indexed\nas-set:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple\nmembers:

an as-set object forms a set of as numbers that can be referenced in many of the places where an as number reference can be used. sets can be built with hierarchical names and can also include direct references to other sets. references can also be made indirectly by using the “mbrs-by-ref:” attribute. for more details see the section about sets.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the as-set object\n\n * “as-set:” – this attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘as-‘. it can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). at least one component must be an as-set name. the others can be more set names or as numbers. all the set name components of a hierarchical name have to be as-set names. for more details see the section on sets.\n * “descr:” – a short description related to the object.\n * “members:” – these attributes list the direct members of the set. they can be either lists of as numbers, or other as-set names.\n * “mbrs-by-ref:” – these attributes can be used in all set objects. they allow indirect population of a set. if this attribute is used, the set also includes objects of the corresponding type (aut-num objects for as-set, for example) that are protected by one of these maintainers and whose "member-of:" attributes refer to the name of the set. if the value of a "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is any, any object of the corresponding type referring to the set is a member of the set. if there are no "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes, the set is defined explicitly by the "members:" attributes. for more details see the section about sets.\n * “mnt-lower:” – when creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present. otherwise the “mnt-by:” mntner objects can be used for authorisation. for more details see the section about sets.\n\n\n# description of the filter-set object\n\nbelow is the object template for the filter-set object. it lists all possible attributes

policies, it is often useful to define sets of objects. a filter-set object defines a set of routes that match the criteria that you specify in your \'filter\' – in other words, it filters out the routes that you do not want to see. the policy filter can match routes using any bgp path attribute, such as the destination address prefix, as-path, or community attributes. although the “filter:” and “mp-filter:” attributes are ‘single\', they can be composite by using the operators and, or, and not.\n\nsets can be built with hierarchical names. unlike other set objects the filter-set object does not include the “members:” or "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the filter-set object\n\n * “filter-set:” – this attribute defines the name of the set which must start with ‘fltr-‘. it can be a hierarchical name with components separated by a colon (:). at least one component must be a filter-set name. the others can be more set names or as numbers. all the set name components of a hierarchical name must be filter-set names. for more details, see the section about sets.\n * “descr:” – a short description related to the object.\n * “filter:” – this attribute defines the policy filter of the set. this is a logical expression which, when applied to a set of routes, returns a subset of these routes. these are the ones that you want to filter in or filter out. a filter-set object is required by business rules to include either a “filter:” or an “mp-filter:” attribute. one of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n * “mp-filter:” – this attribute extends the "filter:" attribute to allow you to specify ipv4 or ipv6 prefixes and prefix ranges. a filter-set object is required by business rules to include either a “filter:” or an “mp-filter:” attribute. one of these must exist, but you cannot include both attributes.\n * “mnt-lower:” – when creating hierarchical sets, more specific object creations can be authorised using the “mnt-lower:”, if present, otherwise they can be authorised by “mnt-by:” mntner objects. for more details see the section about sets.\n\n\n# description of the inet-rtr

can be set up as well as specifying which as number owns/operates the router.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the inet-rtr object\n\n * “inet-rtr:” – this attribute is a valid dns name of the router described by this object. it cannot end with a dot.\n * “descr:” – a short description related to the object.\n * “alias:” – each optional “alias:” attribute is a canonical dns name for the router.\n * “local-as:” – this attribute specifies the as number of the as which owns/operates this router.\n * “ifaddr:” - this attribute specifies the interface address and mask length within an internet router, as well as an optional action to set other parameters on this interface.\n * “interface:” – this attribute specifies an interface address, this can be multi-protocol. it can have an optional action, examples being rpsl preferences, prepending and med. also an optional tunnel definition can be included.\n * “peer:” – this attribute specifies the details of any interior or exterior router peering. this can be specified using either an ip address of the peer router or its inet-rtr name. a group of peers can be specified using an rtr-set name or a peering-set name. if peering-set name form is used, only the peerings in the corresponding peering set that are with this router are included.\n * “mp-peer:” – this attribute extends the "peer:" attribute to support both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses.\n * “member-of:” - references a set object that this router wants to be a member of. this membership claim must be acknowledged by a respective "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute in the referenced set object.\n\n\n# description of the peering-set object\n\nbelow is the object template for the peering-set object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.

it is often useful to define sets of objects. a peering-set object defines a set of peerings that you specify in the “peering:” or “mp-peering:” attribute. it identifies all the peerings between a (set of) local routers and a (set of) peer routers. although the “peering:” and “mp-peering:” attributes are ‘single\', they can be composite by using the operators and, or, and except. except is equivalent to ‘and not\'.\n\nsets can be built with hierarchical names. unlike other set objects the peering-set object does not include the “members:” or "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\ndescription of

object includes security information for use by csirt teams as they communicate with each other.\n\nthe irt object may only be referenced from inetnum and inet6num objects to show which csirt is responsible for handling computer and network incidents for that address range. use is made of the hierarchical nature of address space. any reference in an inet(6)num object to an irt object applies not only to the referencing object but also to all more specific address space. so the more specific objects inherit the reference to the irt object. when querying address space for an irt reference, the query software takes account of this inheritance and queries up the hierarchy looking for the nearest applicable irt object reference. this information is returned when any more specific inet(6)num object is queried. where irt references are made at multiple points in an address space hierarchy, the closest less specific reference applies.\n\nadding a reference to an irt object requires authorisation from the maintainer of the irt object. this is handled using the "auth:" attribute of the irt object. although the reference to an irt object from an inet(6)num object is made using the "mnt-irt:" attribute, it should be clear that the irt object is not a mntner object. the irt object contains contact information and is more similar to a role object than a mntner object.\n\nthe contact details provided by an irt object must be business information and must not contain any personal information.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the irt object\n\n *

authorisation in the ripe database and who has a private key can store their public key in a key-cert object. it is used with the mntner and irt objects. you cannot create a public/private key pair using the ripe database software. you must use some external software to create your keys and then copy the certificate data into the key-cert object.\n\ncurrently, the ripe database supports two types of keys, pgp and x.509.\n\nthe pgp certificate can be used to authorise updates to the ripe database and for signing and encrypting correspondence with a csirt using an irt object (see the sub-sections \'description of the irt object\' and ‘description of the mntner object\' for more details). the "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘pgp-nnnnnnnn\' where the key-id nnnnnnnn is a hexadecimal number. these keys are compliant with the open pgp message format. pgp keys using an elliptic curve algorithm are not currently supported (e.g. curve 25519, nist, secg, ecc brainpool etc.).\n\nthe x.509 certificate can be used to sign and encrypt correspondence with a csirt using an irt object. it may work in some circumstances for authorising updates to the ripe database but we cannot guarantee this. the "key-cert:" attribute takes the format ‘x509-nnn\' where key-id nnn is an integer number starting with 1. if you want to create an x.509 key-cert object you must follow this appendix.\n\nthe "method:", "owner:" and "fingerpr:" attributes are all generated by the software. it is not necessary to include these attributes when you create or modify one of these objects. if any of them are supplied, the software will check the values. if the value is wrong for any reason, the software will replace the supplied values with generated values. in this case, a warning will be returned to the user.\n\nin case of performing rest updates using this authentication method client certificate authentication api needs to be used.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the key-cert object\n\n * "key-cert:" – this attribute specifies the key-id. this is used in "auth:" attributes of the mntner and irt objects.\n * "method:" – this attribute defines the type of the public key. currently, only pgp and x509 are supported.\n * "owner:" – this attribute specifies the owner of the public key. this information must be supplied when you create the key. the ripe database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "fingerpr:" – this attribute is an identifier of the public key. the ripe database software extracts this information from the key data when the key-cert object is created.\n * "certif:" – the value of the public key should be supplied either using multiple "certif:" attributes, or in one "certif:" attribute. in the first case, this is easily done by exporting the key from your local key ring in ascii-armored format and adding the string "certif:" to the start of each line of the key. in the second case, line continuation should be used to represent an ascii-armored format of the key. all the lines of the exported key must be included, not forgetting the begin and end markers and the empty line that separates the header from the key body.\n\n\n# description of the mntner object\n\nbelow is the object template for the mntner object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nattribute name  presence   repeat     indexed\nmntner:         mandatory  single     primary/lookup key\ndescr:          optional   multiple  \norg:            optional

\n\n\nobjects in the ripe database are protected using mntner objects. a mntner object is an anonymous box containing the credentials needed to authorise creation, deletion or modification of any objects that it protects by whomever maintains this data. currently, these credentials are md5 passwords or pgp keys or single sign-on user names from the ripe ncc access system. the syntax also allows for x.509 certificates, but these are not fully implemented throughout the whois software.\n\nobjects are protected by a mntner, if they contain a reference to the mntner in the object. this is done by including a "mnt-by:" attribute. other "mnt-xxx:" attributes offer hierarchical protection. the "mnt-by:" attribute is mandatory in all object types.\n\na mntner object can be referenced either as a single mntner or comma-separated list of mntners.\n\nmost users set the "mnt-by:" value in a mntner to reference itself. that makes it maintain itself. but this is not always the case. there are situations where someone wants to control who maintains a set of objects. this can be done by using mnt-a to maintain mnt-b. the object mnt-b contains the credentials to maintain a set of data. these credentials are set up by mnt-a.\n\nto update an object protected by a mntner the authorisation must be passed from one of the "auth:" values in the mntner object referenced in one of the "mnt-by:" attributes of the updated object. this means that the correct credential for one of the "auth:" values must be supplied as part of the update. if an object references more than one mntner in the "mnt-by:" attributes, they act as a logical \'or\'. if the authorisation is passed by any "auth:" value from any of the referenced *mntner objects, then the update will be authorised.\n\nthe "mnt-lower:", "mnt-routes:" and "mnt-domains:" attributes all provide for hierarchical authorisation. these also work in a logical \'or\' when multiple values are included in an object. how they are used is described in the object descriptions where these attributes are valid.\n\nfor more detailed information about using mntner attributes, see the section ‘authorisation\'.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the mntner object\n\n * "mntner:" – this attribute specifies the name of the mntner object. it should end in ‘-mnt\', but the software has never enforced this.\n * "descr:" – a short description related to the object.\n * "upd-to:" – this attribute specifies an email address where a notification will be sent when an attempt to update an object protected by this mntner is unsuccessful due to authorisation failure. if there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-nfy:" – this attribute specifies the email address where a notification will be sent when an object protected by this mntner is successfully updated. if there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * "mnt-ref:" – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this mntner object in any other object.\n * "auth:" – this attribute defines an authentication scheme to be used. any of the current authentication schemes used by the ripe database are allowed.\n\n\n# description of the organisation

the ripe database. this may be a company, non-profit group or individual. it was introduced as a means to link together all of the human and internet resources related to one organisation.\n\nthis object is the central starting point for managing data in the ripe database. all your other objects are related to this object. if you manage any aspect of any resource then you should have an organisation object so that other people know who you are, what you maintain and how to contact you.\n\nthe organisation object should only contain business information. even if the organisation is an individual, it should not include any personal information.\n\nadding references to an organisation object requires authorisation from the organisation. removing them does not need any authorisation. the maintainer of the organisation object can choose to be notified when any reference is added or removed.\n\nthis object is created for new members by the ripe ncc with "org-type: lir". these objects are required to include an "abuse-c:" attribute referencing an abuse contact object.\n\nthe member organisation objects are partly managed by the ripe ncc and partly by the member. because of this joint management, with the ripe ncc mntner as the "mnt-by:", these objects are locked out of normal updates by members. the parts that the member can change can only be edited in the lir portal object editors.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the organisation object\n\n * "organisation:" – this attribute specifies the id of an organisation object. when creating an object, you must specify an "auto" id by setting the value of the attribute to "auto-1" or "auto-1<lettercombination>" ,so the database will assign the id automatically. the id will always start with the string ‘org-‘ prefix, followed by 2 to 4 letters, digits, a dash and the database source. if deleted, it is not possible to recreate an organisation object with the same id.\n * “org-name:” – this attribute specifies the name of the organisation that this organisation object represents in the ripe database.\n * “org-type:” – this attribute specifies the type of the organisation. it takes one of the following fixed values. uses can only create organisation objects with the type ‘other\'. the rest of the values can only be set by the ripe ncc.\n   * \'iana\' – only used for internet assigned numbers authority\n   * \'rir\' – only used for the five regional internet registries\n   * \'nir\' – this is for national internet registries (there are no nirs in the ripe ncc service region, but it is used by apnic)\n   * \'lir\' – this represents all the local internet registries (the ripe ncc members)\n   * \'whitepages\' – a little-used historical idea for people who have a ‘significant\' presence in the industry but who don\'t manage any resources in the ripe database.\n   * \'direct_assignment\' – used for organisations who have a direct contract with ripe ncc\n   * \'other\' – this represents all organisations that do not fit any of the above categories.\n * “descr:” – a short description related to the object.\n * "country:" - this is the country for the organisation. can only be added, modified or removed by the ripe ncc if the organisation is referenced from ripe ncc (jointly) maintained resources.\n * “phone:” – this is a phone number for the business contact represented by this organisation object. it specifies a telephone number in international shorthand. it must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – this is a fax number for the business contact represented by this organisation object.\n * “e-mail:” – this is a business email address for the organisation represented by this object.\n * “geoloc:” – the geolocation coordinates for the resource in decimal degrees notation. format is latitude followed by longitude, separated by a space. latitude ranges from [-90,+90] and longitude from [-180,+180].\n * “language:” – identifies the language as a two-letter code from the iso 639-1 language code list.\n * “abuse-c:” – this attribute references an abuse contact object. this can only be a role object that contains an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. making this reference will remove any query limits for that role object, which must only include business data (no personal information).\n * “ref-nfy:” – this attribute specifies an email address where a notification will be sent when a reference to an organisation object is added or removed. if there are multiple attributes, all specified email addresses will receive a direct email to that address.\n * “mnt-ref:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this organisation object in any other object.\n * “address:” – this is a full postal address for the business contact represented by this organisation object.\n\n\n# description of the person object\n\nbelow is the object template for the person object. it lists all possible attributes that are allowed in this object type.\n\nattribute

should only be used for contacts responsible for technical or administrative issues relating to internet resources registered in the ripe database. however, the business model used by many resource holders is to also document end user customers who have been assigned a resource. one of its purposes is defined as a contact database for people who manage resources. it is not easy to distinguish between customers and contacts from the person object, unless it is documented in "remarks:". the person object is the only object in the ripe database that should contain any personal information. the "person:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. the name in the "person:" attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nthe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. for these objects the primary key is the "nic-hdl:" attribute. both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. so it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. the two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. but it is not possible to convert one into the other. it is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nif a person object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same nic handle. this rule was only introduced in 2009. before that date, the nic handles could be re-used. some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference nic handles. a person or role object in the database that currently has that nic handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this nic handle in the historical reference.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the person object\n\n * "person:" – this attribute specifies the full name of the contact person. it must have at least two words in the name.\n * “address:” – this is a full postal address for the contact represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – this is a phone number for the contact represented by this object. it specifies a

automatically. if an auto id is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-ripe\'. if you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. for example dw-ripe, dw-nl and dw are all valid nic handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this person object in any other object.\n\n\n# description of the poem object\n\nbelow shows the object template for the poem object. it lists all

to a person object. however, instead of describing a single person, it describes a role performed by one or more people. this might be a help desk, network monitoring centre, team of system administrators, etc. a role object is useful since often a person performing a specific function may change while the role itself remains.\n\nthe role object should only include business information about the role. it should not contain any personal information, although it can reference person objects. the original intention was that the role object should be used in every other object where contacts are referenced. the person object was only intended to be referenced by the role object. however, business rules were never built into the software to enforce this. as a consequence, the person and role objects have been used inter changeably in almost any situation where contacts are referenced. the "role:" attribute is not the primary key of this object, even though it is the first attribute. the name in the “role:” attribute can be changed by the user.\n\nthe person and role objects are the only objects where the first attribute is not (even part of) the primary key of the database object. for these objects the primary key is the “nic-hdl:” attribute. both these objects ‘share\' the use of the primary key. so it is not possible to have a person object with the same “nic-hdl:” value as a role object. the two objects have become almost interchangeable and in most situations either can be used. but it is not possible to convert one into the other. it is not possible to determine if an object is a person or role object from the “nic-hdl:”.\n\nif a role object is deleted, it is not possible to recreate it with the same nic handle. this rule was only introduced in 2009. before that date, the nic handles could be re-used. some caution should be exercised when looking at the history of objects that reference nic handles. a person or role object in the database now with that nic handle may not be the same person or contact as the one using this nic handle in the historical reference.\n\nreferences to person objects is optional. a help desk can be represented by a role object. the role contains all the details needed to contact the help desk. it may not be necessary to identify the individuals who make up a team to provide support. anyone with a problem will contact the help desk and ‘someone\' will respond and provide support. therefore, no person objects need to be referenced by this help desk role object.\n\ndescription of attributes specific to the role object\n\n * "role:" – this attribute specifies a name for the role. as this is business data rather than personal data, the structure of the “role:” value is similar to the “org-name:” in the organisation object.\n * “address:” – this is a full postal address for the role represented by this object.\n * “phone:” – this is a phone number for the role represented by this object. it specifies a telephone number in international shorthand. it must start with a \'+\' followed by the international country code, area code and number, optionally be followed by an extension number.\n * “fax-no:” – this is a fax number for the role represented by this object.\n * “e-mail:” – this is an email address for the role represented by this object.\n * “abuse-mailbox:” – the role object is the only place that this attribute should be used. it represents the email address to be used when someone wants to report abuse from an internet resource. a role object with an “abuse-mailbox:” attribute can be referenced by an “abuse-c:” attribute in an organisation object. for more details see the section on abuse handling.\n * “nic-hdl:” – this attribute specifies the id of a role object. when creating an object, you can specify an "auto" id by setting the value of the attribute to ‘auto-1\' or ‘auto-1<lettercombination>\', so the database will assign the id automatically. if an auto id is requested, it will always end with the source name, e.g. ‘-ripe\'. if you choose the value yourself you can use a two-letter international country code instead of the source at the end or you can just leave out this suffix. for example dw-ripe, dw-nl and dw are all valid nic handles.\n * “mnt-ref:” – this attribute references mntner objects that provide a set of authorisation tokens used for creating references to this role object in any other object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# set objects\n\nthroughout this section we have used the as-set object as an example. the same rules apply to all the different set object types.\n\n\n# creating set objects\n\nnewly created as-set names must be hierarchical. the hierarchy consists of a series of other as-set names separated by colons (:). anything to the left of a colon is considered a parent, anything to the right is considered a child. at each stage, the whole of the hierarchy, including the colons, is considered as a single string that forms an object name. the set hierarchy can optionally start with an as number reference as the top-level parent.\n\nexisting as-set names can be short (i.e. with a name only, e.g. as-test) or hierarchical (i.e. with a name and as number reference(s), e.g. as3333:as-test). it is now mandatory to only use hierarchical names to create an as-set object, so that the creation is authenticated by the as number holder. this restriction does not apply to the other set types.\n\nas-list1:as-cust\n\nas3333:as-ripe:as-apnic\n\nare both valid as-set names\n\nin each case, the whole string is the name of the as-set. so "as-list1:as-cust" is a set name, including the colon :. but also "as-list1" is a set name and this set is the parent of the set "as-list1:as-cust".\n\nin the second case, "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" is a set and it is the child of the set "as3333:as-ripe". the \'parent\' of this set is as3333, which is an aut-num object and not a set.\n\nfor each new (child) set object in a hierarchy, the immediate parent object must exist at the time of creating the new child set object. this is everything to the left of the last colon in the new child set object name, taken as a single (hierarchical) object name. only one level of parent is checked. if any of the higher levels of parent objects have been deleted, it will not affect the creation of the new child object. the parent is only needed for authorisation.\n\ntherefore, if we were to create a new set "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic:as-customers" then the immediate parent object, "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" must exist to authorise the new set creation. however, it does not matter if higher parent objects still exist, like "as3333:as-ripe".\n\nif an as number is the first element in the hierarchical set name (the top-level parent) then the corresponding aut-num object must exist in order to create the next level in the hierarchy as this is the parent object. however, it is only needed for authorisation.\n\ntherefore, to create the set "as3333:as-ripe", the aut-num object "as3333" must exist to provide authorisation.\n\nif an as number appears anywhere else in the set name hierarchy it is treated as part of a set name and the aut-num object does not need to exist. you cannot have as numbers as the first two levels in the name hierarchy. the second level could not be created, as there must be at least one element starting with "as-" in the set name.\n\nso "as3333:as-ripeoriginas1" is a valid set name but as1 is not an aut-num object, it is simply part of this set name.\n\n"as3333:as1" is not valid as it does not contain an "as-" string defining an as-set name.\n\n"as3333:as1:as-customers" is also not valid as it would require "as3333:as1" to exist as the parent to authorise the creation of this set.\n\nonly hierarchical as-set objects can be created. if the set name is a single as-set (starting with as- and with no colons) then it is considered to be non-hierarchical,\n\nthe as-set object can also list members of the set with a "members:" attribute. the as-set and aut-num objects referenced in a "members:" attribute do not need to exist.\n\n\n# modifying and deleting set objects\n\nany intermediate set can be deleted from the hierarchy. this includes everything from the highest-level parent (which is a non-hierarchical as-set or aut-num object) to the lowest-level parent (which is everything to the left of the last colon in the name of the lowest level child object).\n\nin the case of "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic:as-customers", it is possible to delete any of these individual objects:\n\n"as3333"\n\n"as3333:as-ripe"\n\n"as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic"\n\nthey can also be recreated, as the check is only that the immediate parent object (to the left hand side of the last colon of the object name being created) exists. it does not check any higher-level parents or any existing child objects (right hand side of the colon). if several intermediate parents have been deleted, they can only be recreated in the correct sequence, starting with the highest level.\n\nin the case of "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic:as-customers", suppose we delete: "as3333" and "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" but not "as3333:as-ripe". we can recreate "as3333:as-ripe:as-apnic" as its parent object is "as3333:as-ripe" and this object still exists. authorisation is required from the existing parent object to recreate the child object.\n\nthere is an issue if the top-level parent is an as-set object and it is deleted. suppose we have the set "as-ripe:as3333:as-ripe:as-customers" and all the parents exist. (note that this is subtly different to the set object above, as the top-level parent of this set is a set object, not an aut-num object.) we can delete the top-level parent set "as-ripe". the remaining sets "as-ripe:as3333" to "as-ripe:as3333:as-apnic:as-customers" are still valid. however, anyone can now recreate the deleted top-level parent set "as-ix". this has no parent and therefore requires no hierarchical authorisation. this only becomes a problem if the next-level child set is deleted and the user tries to recreate it. authorisation is now required from the new parent set that is owned by someone else.\n\nif there are any aut-num objects with "member-of:" attributes referencing an as-set object then this as-set object cannot be deleted. if the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes are removed from the as-set object, it still cannot be deleted if there are any existing "member-of:" references to it.\n\na "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute can be removed from an as-set object even if there are "member-of:" references to this as-set object. the "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute is only needed for validation of an object\'s claim to membership of the set. a modification to an aut-num object with a "member-of:" reference to this as-set object will fail unless the "member-of:" reference is removed from the aut-num object.\n\nthe as-set object can be deleted if it has "members:" listed in the object that do exist. however, if there are "member-of:" references to the set in other objects, this set object cannot be deleted, even if you first remove the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes.\n\n\n# the route-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the route-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include route and route6 objects instead of aut-num object.\n * "member:" attributes include other route-set objects\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'rs-\'\n * the set name can also include as numbers\n\n\n# the rtr-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the rtr-set object as to the as-set object but the "member:" attributes include inet-rtr objects instead of aut-num objects.\n * "member:" attributes also include other rtr-set objects\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'rtrs-\'\n * the set name can also include as numbers\n\n\n# the peering-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the peering-set object as to the as-set object\n * there are no "member:" attributes\n * "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes also include other peering-set objects\n * there are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "peering:" and "mp-peering:" attributes. objects referenced in these attributes do not need to exist on creation and can be deleted later\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'prng-\'\n * the set name can also include as numbers\n\n\n# the filter-set object\n\n * the same rules apply to the filter-set object as to the as-set object\n * there are no "member:" attributes\n * "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes also include other filter-set objects\n * there are no referential integrity checks on the values of the "filter:" and "mp-filter:" attributes. objects referenced in these attributes do not need to exist on creation and can be deleted later\n * the set name must have an element starting with \'fltr-\'\n * the set name can also include as

specific types of queries. for command-line queries and for api searches, these flags can be used directly. for web queries, some of the flags can be selected by ticking appropriate check boxes, others can be typed as part of the query string. there are some flags that make no sense with web queries and streamed output, for example -k for a persistent connection or –g to turn off grouping, as grouping is disabled by default in the streamed output.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# abuse contacts\n\nthere are many attributes in objects within the ripe database containing e-mail addresses. these addresses cover a number of functions. a growing concern to engineers and administrators that maintain networks is receiving spam and abuse complaints that are sent to every e-mail address displayed. this will get the message to the right person,but it also causes more spam and abuse to people who are not responsible for solving these problems.\n\nto solve this issue, an "abuse-c:" attribute is available in the organisation object. this optional attribute references a role object which is required to contain an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. any internet resource object (inetnum, inet6num, aut-num) that references this organisation object is then "covered" by this abuse email address.\n\nby default, any query for an internet resource object will return the related abuse email address. this appears in the query output as a comment line (starting with the % \'characters).\n\nthere is also a -b query flag to find the "abuse-mailbox:" attributes for any specific range. it returns the resource primary key with any abuse contact email address found. also the prefix of any corresponding route or route6 objects, followed by the "abuse-mailbox:" attributes.\n\nif no abuse contact is found in any encompassing objects then no object summaries will be returned.\n\na complaint will not be handled any quicker by copying your message to any other e-mail address found in the database.\n\nthe -b query flag cannot be used with many other query flags.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# access control for queries\n\nthe control mechanism is based on the amount of contact information (contained in person and role objects) that is returned because of any queries made. limits are based on the ip address of a whois client sending queries to the database server. sometimes an ip address may be acting as a proxy and submitting queries on behalf of other ip addresses (for example, a webserver providing an interface to the ripe database). the database server provides a facility for such proxy clients that allows accounting to be based on the ip address of the clients using the proxy to query the ripe database and not on the ip address of the proxy server. this is done using the -v flag as follows:\n\n-v <version>,<ipv4-address>\n\n\nwhere\n\n * <version> is a client tag that usually represent the software version that the proxy uses\n * <ipv4-address> is the ipv4 address of the client that queries the database using the proxy\n\nnot all users can use this -v flag. you must contact ripe database administration and tell us why you need this facility. if we approve your request, we will add the ip address of the proxy server to an access control list. you can then use the -v flag, but only from your stated ip address.\n\nattempting to use the -v flag without approval may result in permanent denial of access to the ripe database. this denial of access will apply to the ip address that submits the query.\n\nwe restrict access to stop people using the ripe database to collect excessive amounts of contact data. if the amount of contact data returned by all your queries in a day (defined by utc) exceeds defined limits, a temporary block on access is applied to that ip address. this block will be automatically released at midnight (utc) to allow querying to continue. there is also a limit on the number of times an ip address can be blocked and recover. when this limit is reached, that ip address is permanently blocked from accessing the ripe database. this permanent block will not be automatically removed. the limits are defined in the ripe database acceptable use policy\n\nthere are many reasons why you could find yourself in this position. one is that you are mining the ripe database for contact data to use for non-agreed purposes. in this case, the denial of access is justified and your ip address will remain on the blocked list. however, there may be other reasons. queries for object types other than person and role objects return contact information by default. using the -r or --no-referenced flag to prevent contact data being included in your query results can turn of this default. alternatively, you may have an error in a script that runs automatically, retrieving contact data that you did not know about. if you believe there was a genuine error or mistake that led to the permanent block, you need to contact ripe database administration. explain the error and tell us what steps you have taken to stop it happening again. ripe database administration will decide whether to remove the block. it will remain on record that this ip address has been permanently blocked and unblocked. if another permanent block occurs, we will be less likely to consider removing it a second time.\n\neach time a person or role object is retrieved, a counter increases. when it reaches the limit defined in the aup, the query execution is aborted and the connection is terminated, displaying an error message to the client (see "access errors" in appendix c,ripe database query server response codes and messages). also a count of denials increases. retrieving any other object type does not affect these counters.\n\nany role object used for abuse contacts with an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute is exception to this rule. no accounting is done on these objects.\n\nthere is also a limit on the number of simultaneous connections from a host. when this limit is reached, further connections from the same host are refused.\n\nif we block your access, you will not be able to query for any object types. we will not just block your access to contact date alone.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# filtering the query response\n\na filtering process restricts some data from the default query response. this applies to email contact data. when a user is searching for abuse contact data, they sometimes take all email addresses found in all objects in the query response. this may include the correct address. however, it often also includes many other addresses for people who are not responsible for handling such complaints.\n\nto help overcome this issue, some attributes containing email addresses are filtered out of the default response. one exception to this is where a role object includes an "abuse-mailbox:" attribute. the abuse email address is never filtered. if you include the -b or --no-filtering query flag then the response will not be filtered\n\nwhen any attribute has been filtered out of an object in the query response, a "note:" is added to the response header to warn the user. in addition, the "source:" attribute of each filtered object in the response will have a comment added to the end of the line saying "# filtered". if this filtered output is cut and pasted into an update message, including this end of line comment on the "source:" attribute, the update will be rejected for any filtered object. this is because some mandatory attributes may be missing and the "source:" will not be recognised. filtered output can therefore not be accidentally used for updates.\n\nany "auth:" attribute of mntner objects apart from those which reference to key-cert objects are always filtered when these objects are queried. this filtering cannot be turned off with any query flags. the only way to see an unfiltered mntner object is to authenticate using a password or sso credential that matches an auth: attribute on the mntner.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# getting all the members of set objects\n\nin rpsl, an object can be a member of a set object in two ways.\n\n * you can list objects in a "members:" attribute in the set object.\n\n * you can use the "member-of:" attribute. you can use this in route, route6, aut-num and inet-rtr object types. the value of the "member-of:" attribute identifies a set object that this object wants to be a member of.\n\nhowever, just specifying "member-of:" is not enough. the referenced set object must also have a "mbrs-by-ref:" attribute. this lists the maintainer of the object that wants to be a member of the set. this means that the set owner must validate the membership claim of an object with a "member-of:" attribute. it does this by matching the "mnt-by" line of the object with one of the maintainers in the "mbrs-by-ref:" attributes of the set object.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# grouping the ripe database output\n\nthere are two ways to order the objects in a query response.\n\none way is for the first part of the response to list the objects that are the direct results of the query. then, the second part of the response lists all the secondary objects that are directly referenced from the objects in the first part of the response, like organisation and person. if any of these secondary objects are referenced by more than one of the returned objects, it will only be listed once in the response.\n\n$ whois  -i mb aardvark-mnt\n\nmntner:         aardvark-mnt\nadmin-c:        dw6465-ripe\ntech-c:         dw-ripe\nmnt-by:         aardvark-mnt\n\nkey-cert:

the output will not be grouped.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# historical queries\n\nthe ripe database holds a lot of historical data going back over ten years. this can be of use operationally and statistically. it is possible to query the history of operational data objects that still exist. the available historical data stretches back to the most recent time that the object was (re-)created. if an object is created, modified several times, deleted, recreated and modified again, the available data for this object will cover the most recent creation and modification, as well as the date that it was deleted. this policy of not showing historical data for deleted objects is subject to change.\n\nfor the available historical data, a list can be requested showing the versions with a timestamp. each of these versions of the object can then be queried. also, a diff is available between versions. these historical query flags do not have a short format and can only be used from the command line. these query flags are not available through either the web query form or the restful api.\n\nall timestamps use the utc timezone.\n\nany attribute containing email addresses is filtered out from the query response. these may no longer be related to the object and, also, the owner of the email address may not want to receive any further communications concerning this data. it is also not possible to query for historical personal data objects i.e. person and role.\n\n“—list-versions”\n\nthe response to this is a list of available object versions with a timestamp. this timestamp is the date that an update was processed by the database server to create this version of the object. it is a system-generated timestamp; it is not information supplied by the user. the format looks like this:\n\n$ whois --list-versions 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% version history for inetnum object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255"\n% you can use "--show-version rev#" to get an exact version of the object.\n\n% this object was deleted on 2003-03-17 13:03\n\nrev#  date              op.\n\n1     2003-03-17 13:15  add/upd\n2     2003-04-12 08:32  add/upd\n3     2003-05-22

history for 193.0.7.35. even though this is part of the above range, these queries work on objects not hierarchies. although this object existed prior to 2003-03-17, that part of the history is not available as it was deleted on this date.\n\n“—show-version #n”\n\nthis query will return one version of an object from the history list. taking version #10 from the above example, the query response will look like this:\n\n$ whois --show-version 10 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n% version 10 of object "193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255"\n% this version was a update operation on 2011-02-17 12:11\n% you can use "--list-versions" to get a list of versions for an object.\n\ninetnum:        193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\nnetname:        ripe-ncc\ndescr:          ripe network coordination centre\ndescr:

between two versions from the history list. checking the difference between versions 10 and 11 in the example above will look like this:\n\n$ whois --diff-versions 10:11 193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\n\n%

--inverse) must also be specified with appropriate query flag arguments. inverse keys are defined in the templates of the ripe database objects. (see section \'rpsl object types\' for more details.) these templates can be listed by querying the ripe database. see section \'accessing the object templates\' for more details. see table 3: query flag arguments to the “-” query flag and the corresponding inverse keys\n\nby performing an inverse query, the user requests all objects to be returned from the database that contain the specified query argument in the attribute(s) specified in the query flag arguments.\n\nif you are looking for this...                             ...then type this in the query interface:\nall objects where contact person (or role) is xy-ripe      -i person xy-ripe\nall objects that are protected by xy-mnt                   -i mnt-by xy-mnt\nall objects that have xy-mnt as mnt-lower                  -i mnt-lower xy-mnt\nall objects that have xy-mnt as mnt-routes                 -i mnt-routes xy-mnt\nall objects that have org-xyz-ripe as their organisation   -i org org-xyz-ripe\nobject\nall route/route6 objects that are originated by asx        -i origin asx\n\nexample:\n\nwhois -i admin-c <nic-handle>\n\nwill return all objects where the "admin-c:" attribute contains the <nic-handle> specified as the query argument.\n\nyou can specify several query flag arguments to request searches against several attributes in objects. if you want to do this, the query flag arguments should be entered as a comma-separated list with no white spaces. all the attributes searched must contain the same type of value. in other words, all the values must be maintainers or nic-handles or one of the other values listed in the appendix section on supported queries.\n\nexample:\n\nwhois --inverse mb,mnt-lower <mntner name>\n\nwill return all objects where the "mnt-by:" or the "mnt-lower:" attributes contain the <mntner name> specified as the query argument.\n\nexample:\n\nan inverse query can be used to search for references to a person or role in objects. to find a person or role you could search for matching "admin-c", "tech-c", "abuse-c", "zone-c" attributes, however you need to specify all attributes separately. instead you can specify "person" or "pn" to search all such attributes.\n\nwhois -i admin-c,tech-c,abuse-c,zone-c <person value>\n\nwill return the same results as\n\nwhois -i pn <person value> or whois -i person <person value>\n\nfinding the references for a person is very useful when someone leaves the company and you want to delete all the registers from this person. note that you can also specify a role instead of a person:\n\nwhois -i pn <role value>\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# irr toolset support\n\nthe irrtoolset is a third-party suite of routing policy analysis tools. some of the tools in this set access routing registry servers through an authorisation whois interface.\n\nthe ripe database server includes support for these query types. this section describes the additions to the ripe database user interface that allow it to support the irrtoolset. the required queries are:\n\n * return the prefixes of all route and route6 objects with a specified origin – whois -ki origin<asn>\n * return only the primary keys of the route and route6 objects, not full objects – whois –ktroute,route6 <prefix>\n * return the prefixes of all route and route6 objects referenced in a given route-set – whois –k <route-set>\n * return all the members (aut-num or as-set object) of a specified as-set. this returns only the "members:" attributes, not the full object – whois –k <as-set>\n * optionally, include support for expansion of the previous query, if the returned value contains references to as-sets, so that the result contains only a list of aut-num objects.\n\nthe ripe database server does not support this and it is up to the client to perform the expansion. the irrtoolset currently does the expansion.\n\n * return route and route6 objects that exactly match a specified prefix - whois –bgxtroute,route6 193.0.0.0/21\n * return route and route6 objects that exactly match a specified prefix (as above), but return only the "route:" or "route6:" attributes prefix - whois –kxtroute,route6 193.0.0.0/21\n\nsee table 4: query support for tools\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# more and less specific lookups for reverse domains\n\nthe ripe database supports ip network queries including the -x, -m, -m, -l and -l functionality for reverse delegation domains. if you want to include reverse delegation domains in the query response when using the more or less specific or exact match query flags. you must also include the -d query flag, this will return all domain objects for the address range.\n\nplease note that there is no hierarchy allowed with reverse domain objects. these queries work on the address space hierarchies and return the corresponding domain object, if found, for any address space objects in the query response.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# other query flags\n\n * the “-t” (“--select-types”) query flag\n * the “-k” (“--primary-keys”) query flag\n * the “-t” (“--template”) query flag\n * the “-v” (“--verbose”) query flag\n * the “-q” query flag\n * the “-a” (“--all-sources”) query flag\n * the “-s” (“--sources”) query flag\n * the “-s“ (“--resources" query flag)\n * the “-f” (“--brief”) query flag\n * the “--valid-syntax” and “--no-valid-syntax” query flags\n * the “-c” (“--irt”) query flag\n * the “-c” (“--no-irt”) query flag\n\n\n# the “-t” (“--select-types”) query flag\n\nthis query flag restricts the type of the objects returned to those specified. the query flag argument is a comma-separated list of object types. a space after "t" is optional but the list cannot contain any spaces.\n\n\n# the “-k” (“--primary-keys”) query flag\n\nthe -k (--primary-keys) query flag returns only the primary keys of each object in the query response.\n\nthere are some exceptions to this:\n\n * with set objects, the "members:" attributes will also be returned.\n * with route and route6 objects both the prefix and the "origin:" attribute are returned as these jointly provide the primary key.\n * no information is returned for person, role or organisation objects.\n\n\n# the “-t” (“--template”) query flag\n\nthe -t (--template) query flag returns a template of the specified object type as shown for each object in the section rpsl object types.\n\n\n# the “-v” (“--verbose”) query flag\n\nthe -v (--verbose) query flag returns a verbose description of the specified object type as shown for each object in the section rpsl object types.\n\n\n# the “-q” query flag\n\nthe ripe database server supports the retrieval of certain information about itself and the data sets served, using a -q query flag.\n\nthe -q query flag requests the server to reply with information about the system setup. it does not return any information extracted from any of the databases that it serves. this query flag takes a single argument, which has three possible values:\n\n * version (usage: -q version). this will display version information for the server software\n * types (usage: -q types). this will list all the object types recognised by the ripe database\n * sources (usage: -q sources). this will list all available sources. that is, the local ripe database and all the mirrored databases\n\n\n# the “-a” (“--all-sources”) query flag\n\nthe -a (--all-sources) query flag requests that the server searches all the sources available to it and the response will include any output found from any of the available sources. these are the sources listed by using the –q sources query.\n\n\n# the “-s” (“--sources”) query flag\n\nthe -s (--sources) query flag requests that the server searches all the sources specified and the response will include any output found from any of these sources. the available sources are the sources listed by using the –q sources query. the argument to this flag can be a comma-separated list of sources. they will be queried in the order specified by the user. search other mirrored databases, not only the ripe database.\n\n\n# the “-s” (“--resources) query flag\n\nthe -s (--resources) query flag search in other mirrored databases, such as: ripe-grs or arin-grs, not only the ripe database. for example: whois -s arin-grs 193.201.1.1\n\n\n# the “-f” (“--brief”) query flag\n\nthe “-f” (“--brief”) query flag changes the format of the returned objects. the attribute names are represented in a short hand notation. for example, "person:" becomes "*pn:". using the –f query flag includes the non-recursive action of the –r query flag\n\n\n# the “--valid-syntax” and “--no-valid-syntax” query flags\n\nover time, the syntax of database objects changes. the existing data is not always updated when these changes occur. therefore, there are many objects in the ripe database with invalid syntax according to current rules. these query flags filter the objects in the query response. either those objects with valid syntax, or those without valid syntax, will be returned in the response depending on the choice of flag.\n\n\n# the “-c” (“--irt”) query flag\n\nthe “-c” (“--irt”) query flag can only be used with queries for address space objects. the appropriate address space object for this query is returned in the query response. the query software then searches up the address space hierarchy (moving through the less specific objects) until an address space object is found that references an irt object, and then the referenced irt object is included in the query response. the default behaviour is not to return any referenced irt object.\n\n\n# the “-c” (“--no-irt”) query flag\n\nthe “-c” (“--no-irt”) query flag turns off the behaviour given with the “-c” query flag. related irt objects are not returned by default.\n\n\n# the “-z” (“--charset”) query flag\n\nthe "-z" ("--charset") query flag specifies which character set the client expects. the default is latin-1 (iso-8859-1) encoding.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# persistent connections and keeping state\n\nif you are carrying out batched queries, your database client can request a persistent connection. the server will not close this connection after sending a reply to your client. this avoids having to set up a new tcp connection for every query.\n\nthe client can request this by sending the -k or --persistent-connection query flag to the server. this flag may be sent without a query argument to start the connection. or it may be included as a query flag with the first query.\n\nduring a persistent connection, the server operates a "stop-and-wait" protocol. this means that the next query cannot be sent until the reply has been received to the previous query. if you want to be able to send queries in batch mode, you must use a third-party tool, for example netcat or telnet, or the whois client with the file name ripe-whois-client-3.2.2.tar.gz that can be downloaded and compiled. the default whois client that is available with most operating systems may not allow this.\n\nto exit a persistent connection, send the -k or --persistent-connection flag with no query argument or an empty query (\\n) to the server. the connection will also time out after a period of inactivity.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# queries for autonomous systems\n\nas numbers can be either 32-bit or 16-bit. they are both described by a 32-bit number.from the point of view of the ripe database there is no difference. the difference is mainly historical.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# queries for ip networks\n\nthe ripe database provides information about ip networks allocated or assigned within the ripe ncc service region. this information is mainly stored as inetnum, inet6num, route and route6 objects. these objects store information about a single ip address or ranges of addresses.\n\nthe route and route6 objects use prefix notation to specify the single address or range of addresses about which they contain information.\n\n"prefix notation" specifies ranges using two parts: the prefix and its length.\n\n * for ipv4, the prefix is a 32-bit integer written in dotted quad notation with the value of the lowest ip address in the range. the prefix length is a whole number in the range 0-32 (for example 193.0.0.0/22 specifies the range of 1024 ipv4 addresses starting with,and including, 193.0.0.0).\n * for ipv6 address ranges, the prefix length must be in the range 0-128 and is a 128-bit whole number, written in hexadecimal groups of two bytes separated by colons and with the possible use of shorthand notation for strings of consecutive 0s.\n\nthe inetnum objects represent an ipv4 address space in range notation. the inet6num objects represent ipv6 address space in standard prefix notation.\n\nwhen you query the ripe database for information about ip addresses, you can specify query arguments with the following notations:\n\n * a prefix (ipv4 or ipv6).\n * an explicit range (ipv4 only).\n * a single ip address. this is interpreted as a range of just one address. for ipv4, this can be written in range notation using the same start and end address. it could also be written as a single address. for ipv6, this has a prefix length of 128 or again it could also be written as a single address.\n\nfor ipv4 address space, the query argument can be specified with either prefix or range notation. when prefix notation is used, the database software converts this into range notation. an information message is included in the query response showing the conversions performed. for ipv6 address space, the query argument can only be specified in prefix notation. the single ip address is accepted as a short hand notation for a prefix. see table 2: queries for ip networks table\n\nwe use three terms in these types of queries. these are all defined relative to the specified(reference) range:\n\n * an exact match refers to a range that is identical to the reference range.\n * a more specific range is contained within the reference range and is smaller. it contains fewer ip addresses than the reference range. we also call this a sub range.\n * a less specific range contains the whole of the reference range and is bigger. it has a greater number of ip addresses than the reference range. we also call this an encompassing range.\n\nthere are a number of options that describe how you can retrieve different types of information relative to a particular range of ip addresses (ipv4 or ipv6) including more and less specific queries.\n\n\n# default queries for ip network\n\nif you do not specify one of the following ip related query flags, and your query argument is a range of ip addresses in any one notation, a ripe database server will try to find an object with an exact match range for the specified range. if found, the exact match range is returned. if an exact match range cannot be found, the server looks for the object with the smallest less specific range. this will be the smallest, existing, encompassing range.\n\n\n# exact match queries\n\nif you want to change the default behaviour so that the server returns only an object with an exact match range, you need to use the –x (or --exact) query flag. this flag stops the server from looking for any less specific ranges if no exact match range exists. not even the smallest encompassing range will be returned. if no exact match range is found, no object will be returned in the query response.\n\n\n# more specific range queries\n\nthese refer to queries qualified by the use of the -m and -m query flags.\n\nthese queries will return information about objects with ranges of ip addresses that are fully contained within the reference range specified in the query argument. the returned objects contain fewer addresses than the specified range. more specific range queries do not return the exact match range if it exists.\n\n * -m (or --all-more) - requests that the server should return all the sub-ranges that are completely contained within the reference range. when there are hierarchies of sub-ranges, all levels of the hierarchies will be returned down to the smallest sub-range in each hierarchy. many objects can be returned.\n * -m (or --one-more) - requests that the server should return all the sub-ranges that are completely contained within the reference range. when there are hierarchies of sub-ranges, only the top level of the hierarchies will be returned. these are usually called one level more specific ranges. many objects can be returned.\n\n\n# less specific range queries\n\nthese refer to queries qualified by the use of the -l and -l query flags.\n\nthese queries will return information about objects with ranges of ip addresses that fully contain the reference range specified in the query argument. the returned objects contain a greater number of addresses than the specified range.\n\n * -l (or --all-less) - requests that the server returns the object with an exact match range, if it exists, and all objects with ranges that are bigger than the reference range and that fully contain, or encompass, it. many objects can be returned.\n\n * -l (or --one-less) - requests that the server does not return the object with an exact match range, if it exists. it returns only the object with the smallest range that is bigger than the reference range and that fully contains, or encompasses, it. this is usually referred to as the one level less specific range. only one object can be returned.\n\n\n# less specific range queries for referenced irt objects\n\nan irt object represents a computer security incident response team (csirt). it includes contact and security information. it is optionally referenced from inet(6)num objects using the "mnt-irt:" attribute (even though the irt object is not a mntner object). this shows which csirt is responsible for handling computer and network incidents for that address range.\n\na reference to an irt object does not only apply to the inet(6)num object that contains the reference. it also applies to all inet(6)num objects that are more specific to the one containing the reference. not every inet(6)num object needs to contain a reference to the irt object. the irt reference only needs to be placed in the least specific encompassing object to apply to a whole hierarchy of objects. this makes it easier to apply and maintain.\n\nthere may be more than one inet(6)num object in a hierarchy referencing an irt object. in this case, the one referenced from the smallest encompassing object is the one that applies to the range in question.\n\nthere is a -c (or --irt) query flag to make it easy to find the inet(6)num object containing the reference to an irt object for any specific range.\n\nthis flag makes the server search up the hierarchy of less specific range objects from the range specified as the query argument. the search will stop when the first object is found containing a reference to an irt object. this can be either the specified range or an encompassing inet(6)num object at any level in a hierarchy. the query will return the inet(6)num object found for the range specified in the query argument. the referenced irt object found in the hierarchy will also be returned.\n\nsometimes, no inet(6)num object is found in the hierarchy that contains a reference to an irt object. in this case, the query response will only contain the inet(6)num object found for the range specified in the query argument.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# queries using primary and lookup keys\n\nall objects have a primary key. (see the section \'attributes in an object\' for more details) this is the most basic type of query that can be made in the ripe database. based on the primary key, a very specific instance of an object type can be queried. in almost all cases, a query on a primary key will only return a single object (assuming the query has not selected to include directly referenced objects). in most of those situations, that object will have a primary key that exactly matches the query argument. for example, querying for ‘aardvark-mnt\' will only return the mntner object that has this as its primary key. in this example, you cannot query for a random part of the primary key. for example querying for ‘aardv\' will not return this object. however if you query for ‘aardvark\', you will not return this mntner object, but you will return any object containing the word ‘aardvark\' in a lookup attribute.\n\nin some cases, with hierarchical primary key values, the returned object may not exactly match the query argument. for example, if you query for ‘193.0.7.35\' the returned inetnum object has the primary key value of ‘193.0.0.0 - 193.0.7.255\'. where address space is concerned, route(6) objects are usually returned with the address space object. so, in this case, you not only get objects with different primary keys, but also more than one object could be possibly returned in the query response.\n\nmany objects also have lookup keys. (see attribute section on \'indexed\' for more details.) these are used for search type queries. if you query for ‘aardvark\', the response will include any object where the word ‘aardvark\' has been used in any attribute value of a lookup key, as well as any object where this is the primary key. for primary keys, the key would need to be an exact match with this word. a lookup key value only needs to include this word as part of the value. individual words in lookup keys are separately indexed.\n\nthe terminology is a bit confusing. a query using a primary key is really a ‘lookup\' for a specific object exactly matching the query argument. a query using the lookup keys is really a ‘search\' for any objects containing the query argument.\n\nthere are several query flags that can filter or limit the objects contained in the response.\n\nexamples of all queries using primary and lookup keys are shown in the next table. see table 1: queries using primary and lookup keys\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# referenced objects in query response\n\na standard query will return a set of secondary objects that are directly referenced from the objects in the query response. for example, if the query response returns an inetnum object then, by default, the response will also include any directly referenced organisation, person and role objects. the person and role objects are subject to daily limits. a user can find themselves blocked for excessive querying of personal data objects even if they did not want that information.\n\nthis default behaviour can be turned off so that these secondary objects are not returned. there are two options for doing this:\n\n“-r” or “--no-referenced” with this query flag, none of the referenced secondary objects will be returned in the response. if an inetnum object references a role object as "admin-c:", a person object as "tech-c:", and an organisation object, none of these objects will be returned with the inetnum object.\n\n“--no-personal” this query flag only removes the personal objects, person and role. so, in the example above, the organisation object is still returned (use this flag to avoid getting blocked for excessive querying of personal data).\n\n“--show-personal” this is the opposite of the --no-personal flag. currently, it does not do anything but may be changed in the future.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# ripe ncc global resource service\n\nthe ripe ncc mirrors several other databases, in near real-time, that are considered useful to anyone who queries the ripe database. these include the other regional internet registries (rirs). this allows queries to the ripe database to retrieve information from one or more of the mirrored databases. a local copy is maintained of each mirrored database. daily updates are obtained from the mirrored databases to keep the local copies up-to-date.\n\nthe mirrored databases are referenced by the source of the data. a list of currently available sources can be obtained by using the “-q” query flag.\n\nall mirrored databases are made available by the ripe ncc in rpsl syntax with the same rpsl extensions as the ripe database. if the mirrored data stream has some other syntax, it is converted into ripe database syntax before submission to the local database copy. this means that the data returned to a user who queries a ripe ncc mirror may not be in the same format as data returned by querying the original data source directly.\n\nusers can query the ripe ncc mirrored databases as if they were querying the ripe database by adding the “-s” query flag or “-a” query flag. bulk access to any of the mirrored databases is not possible. the access control mechanism, described in the section on access to personal data, applies to all data returned, regardless of the source.\n\nthe mirrors of the other rirs\' databases only contain the resource information. they do not include all the personal data. to access the personal data users must query the other rir databases directly.\n\nthe resource information received from the other rirs in the daily data dumps is cross-referenced with the daily statistics published by each rir. these statistics detail all the resources that each rir is administratively responsible for. only resources listed in these statistics are entered into the mirrored database. this eliminates any placeholder objects or aggregated blocks used administratively by the rir. the result is a set of databases containing a global view of internet resources administered by the rirs.\n\nthis global database view can be queried collectively using the query flag —resource. this will return a single response from the rir that claims to be administratively responsible for this resource.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# update methods\n\nthe available options for updating the ripe database are:\n\n * restful api\n * webupdates (web form)\n * syncupdates\n * email updates\n\nhowever, these are not all distinct methods of updating the database. some are front-ends to the others.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# email updates\n\nemail updates were the original method of updating the ripe database. they are still used by many people, although synchronous updates by the other methods now account for the majority of updates.\n\nemail update messages must be in plain text and can be mime-encoded. if encoded messages are multipart/signed, the signature part will be associated with the corresponding mime text part. when an encoded message is received, the database software will take each valid mime part (including any related signature part) and merge them into one update message. please see section \'mime support\' for more information.\n\npasswords needed for authorising the updates of all objects in the message must be included somewhere in the message. this is done with the pseudo-attribute "password:", for example:\n\npassword: some clear text\n\n\nthis "password:" pseudo-attribute can be placed anywhere in the message. one attribute is needed for each required password. if the message is mime-encoded the passwords can be in any mime part. when it is all merged into a single update message, all passwords found will apply to all objects in the update. passwords can also be contained within the text part of a signed update message and apply to objects outside the signed part. all credentials will be extracted before any authorisation checks are made. the "password:" pseudo-attributes will be removed before any of the objects are processed. this ensures that they will never be considered as part of any object.\n\nacknowledgements (ack) containing the result of the update are returned to the sender of the email based on the "reply-to:" and "from:" fields in the email header. notifications (notif) may also be sent based on email addresses found in the attributes within each object in the update message and the related mntner objects. see section on notifications.\n\nto submit an email update, send your email message to one of the following email addresses:\n\n * email updates to the ripe database\n * email updates to the test database\n * email updates to the rc database\n\nthere is no limit on how many objects that can be included in an email update message, or mime part. there is a maximum limit on the size of an email message, which is 40 mb.\n\nonly one ack message is returned for each update message. however, there may be many notif messages generated for each object in the update. this can result in large numbers of emails sent out when an update contains many objects. the ack and all notifs are all sent out at the end of processing the whole update message. your mail server needs to be able to handle large numbers of emails coming from a single source (@ripe.net), otherwise they may all get marked as spam. you should optimise the number of update messages and number of objects per update to suit your working practises.\n\n\n# mime support\n\nthe database software supports the mime format. this means that you can cryptographically sign an update message using email agents that attach the signature in a separate mime part, not in the body of the message. however, encryption of the text is not allowed. all update messages must be sent in plain text.\n\nnested signing of messages is possible, allowing an update message to be signed by one user, sent to another user who signs it again and submits the update.\n\nthe database software does not allow any scoping of authorisation within the message (for example, mime parts where different passwords apply).\n\nit is strongly recommended to keep mime encapsulation simple. complex mime structures are more likely to generate errors.\n\nthe following rules apply when submitting updates using mime encapsulation:\n\nthe software will recognise the following headers and take the appropriate actions:\n\n * multipart/signed\n * multipart/alternative\n * multipart/mixed\n * multipart/unknown\n * application/pgp-signature\n * application/x-pkcs7-signature\n * application/pkcs7-signature\n * text/plain\n\nall other content-types are treated as text/plain.\n\nafter extracting credentials and validating signatures, all mime parts are merged together and treated as a single update message.\n\n\n# subject line keywords\n\nthe subject line can have a special meaning in email update messages by using keywords. the available keywords, which are case-insensitive, are:\n\n * new\n * help\n * howto\n\none way to use a keyword is to put the single keyword in the subject line of an email message, with no other words. if any other word is found (for example, subject: new objects) then none of the words will be treated as keywords. all words in the subject line will be reported in the acknowledgement reply as invalid keywords, along with a warning message. in this context, it is impossible to know if a word is meant as a keyword or just part of a comment.\n\nmany users often include their own references in the subject line. using this method, it is not possible to also use a keyword. the user\'s references are reported in the warning message as invalid keywords.\n\nsome examples: subject: new\n\nthis is an accepted keyword. subject: sending my new objects\n\nnone of these words are accepted as a keyword and all reported in the warning message.\n\nuse the new keyword if you want the database to only accept new objects. in this case, all objects found in the update are assumed to be creation operations. if an object already exists in the database, that object will result in an error message in the acknowledgement. however, the remaining objects will still be processed.\n\nthe help keyword causes a piece of text to be returned in the acknowledgement that contains information about how to query and update the database. when this keyword is used the body of the update message, it is ignored. howto performs the same action as the help keyword.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# ripe database restful api\n\nfor more information about the rest paradigm, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representational_state_transfer. all the services are accessible via https. use of the whois rest api is governed by the ripe database terms and conditions\n\n\n# restful uri format\n\neach object in the ripe database has a unique locator uri, in the following format:\n\nhttps://rest.db.ripe.net/{source}/{objecttype}/{key}\n\nwhere:\n\n * source is the database source (e.g. ripe).\n * objecttype is the object type (e.g. inetnum)\n * key is the primary key(s)\n   * normally key is a single attribute value.\n   * use the nic-hdl attribute value for person or role object types.\n   * combine the route(6) attribute value and origin attribute value for route or route6 object types (e.g. route 193.0.22.0/23as3333).\n\n\n# environments\n\nenvironment   protocol   client cert   endpoint\ntest          http       no

\'https://rest.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/tp1-ripe?dry-run=true&password=...\'\n\n\n# request / response encoding\n\nplease take into account the following points to avoid unexpected encoding behaviour:\n\n * objects are stored using the latin-1 (iso-8859-1) character set.\n * if the request character set is not latin-1, then the request body is converted to latin-1. a question mark character (\'?\' or 0x3f) is used as a substitution character, if the character is outside the latin-1 character set.\n * the response should contain a warning, if conversion was necessary. known issue #291\n * unrecognised encodings that cannot be converted to latin-1 will result in an unsuccessful operation.\n * to be absolutely certain of what was stored in the database, do a follow-up query.\n * the rest api response will be in utf-8.\n * we recommend to use utf-8 character encoding in all rest api requests, but restrict the content to valid latin-1 characters.\n\n\n# update latency\n\nit could take up to 10 seconds before an update becomes visible for lookup or search operations. for non-hierarchical object types (person, role, organisation,...), the typical latency is less than 1 second. for hierarchical objects types (inet(6)num, route(6), domain), it is about 3-5 seconds on average, up to 10 seconds maximum.\n\na way to work around this limitation is to rely on the response of the muting operation in rest api (put, post, delete). these all return the object as it appears in the database in their response body after the successful update. this object is never filtered or altered in any way.\n\nany required passwords must also be supplied as part of the uniform resource identifier (uri) using the uri query parameter "password=". one parameter should be used for each password supplied. the pseudo attribute "password:" cannot be used in the http request body. see "email updates" for more information.\n\n\n# client certificate authentication\n\nclient certificate authentication is supported by our rest api. to use the client certificate service, you must have your own certificate: either from a certificate authority (ca) such as let\'s encrypt, or you can generate one yourself.\n\nthe key-cert object\'s client certificate status is validated by checking its notbefore and notafter dates to ensure it is within its designated validity period. this involves comparing the current date against these dates: if the certificate is not yet valid (notbefore) or has expired (notafter), it is considered invalid and an error is raised. this validation ensures that the certificate is only used within its valid time frame, maintaining secure and reliable authentication.\n\nadditionally, signed updates are only considered valid for an hour after they are signed. after that the authentication will fail.\n\n\n# examples\n\n * create your own certificate:\n   * generate the private key: openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048\n   * generate the certificate signing request (csr): openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr\n   * generate the self-signed certificate using the csr: openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -signkey client.key -out client.crt\n * example using curl and previous certificate:\n   * curl --cert client.crt --key client.key -x put --data @form.txt\'https://rest-cert.db.ripe.net/ripe/person/tp1-ripe?dry-run&password=...\'\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# syncupdates\n\nsyncupdates enables updates to the ripe database synchronously, meaning, the result is returned immediately to the user. it is intended for use by applications that need to update the ripe database and are able to process the result afterwards. an interface can easily be created in any language that supports the http protocol. syncupdates supports http get and post methods (both multipart and url-encoded formats). it can also be used directly via a web form.\n\nsyncupdates accepts the following parameters (query params for get, form params for post):\n\n * data\n   this variable should contain the actual update message.\n * new\n   this variable can be either yes or no. if it contains yes, the update will fail if it contains changes to existing objects.\n * help\n   this variable can be either yes or no. if it contains yes, the help message of the whois server will be given as the output.\n\nmultiple objects are accepted in the body, and any required passwords must also be supplied in the body using the "password:" attribute.\n\nafter composing the input and sending it as a post or a get request, the server will return the usual http response headers and the body if an acknowledgement exists.\n\nthe first line of the response will give the result of the transaction, in the form of:\n\nhttp/1.1 (code) (message)\n\nwhere (code) is a three-digit number which is a code for the message. the first digit of the code denotes the type of the message. the rest of the digits are unique for all messages:\n\n * 2xx denotes a successful transaction\n * 4xx denotes that the request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax,\n\nif the code begins with 2, there will be an acknowledgement in the body of the response, in the form of text/plain.\n\nthese are the actual codes returned by

service is to provide updates around the clock, except for maintenance operations. in cases where it\'s not possible to update the database, syncupdates will return with the following message:\n\n"updates are unavailable at the moment. please try again later."\n\nbehind syncupdates, the software has a separate handler to the one used for both the restful api and webupdates. this handler is the same for both scripted access to syncupdates or the web form access. this handler will accept multiple objects in the same update. this allows for a different type of usage to the restful api. a single response is returned to the user with the results of processing all the objects in the update message. the same timing issue applies across the whole update as referred to in the webupdates description above. if an update has a very long list of objects and the http connection times out during the update, the processing of the update will still run to completion. no response message will be returned to the user after an http timeout. notification emails will always be sent on completion.\n\nto modify data without affecting the underlying database, you can use dry-run\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# webupdates\n\nwebupdates can be accessed via the following urls:\n\n * ripe database\n * test database\n * rc database\n\nwebupdates is a graphical front-end for the restful api. it allows objects to be created, modified and deleted from either the ripe or test database and their rc equivalents. object templates are available to guide users through object creation and modification. these can be selected as individual fields or a single text area. in field mode, a template for creating a new object will only show the mandatory attributes. additional and optional attributes can be added to the template as required. in text area mode, the initial template will show all possible attributes for an object type. the mandatory attributes are in upper case and the optional ones are in lower case. it is not possible to switch between the field mode and text area.\n\nwhen the submit key is clicked, the data is sent via the restful api to the database software. this restricts input to single object processing only. if you paste more than one object into a text area, an error will occur.\n\nwhen deleting objects, the full object is presented to you for verification and you must then enter the reason for the deletion.\n\nwhen an object is queried using the webquery form, ‘hover over\' buttons are available to take any object from the query results directly into webupdates to update or delete the object.\n\nobjects up to a maximum size of 10mb can be managed through the webupdates interface. if any errors occur during the update, the error messages are shown either:\n\n * in a single error block at the start of the form- if they are general errors\n * within the form- if the error is specific to a particular attribute and you are using the field mode\n * in a series of error blocks at the start of the form- for errors specific to particular attributes but you are using the text area mode\n\nthere is no maximum amount of time for an update operation to be completed. you should set your timeout to the highest possible value. problems sometimes occur with reverse domain objects. because of all the dns checks made, reverse domain objects sometimes take longer to process, and your connection may occasionally time out. the update will still be completed by the database server, but no acknowledgement will be returned if the connection has timed out. notification messages are always sent by email, and will be sent regardless of your connection status.\n\nany required passwords must also be supplied. these can be entered via the form password field. when using the text area input mode, passwords can also be included the message body using the "password:" attribute. more information about passwords is available in \'email updates\'\n\n\n# creating basic ripe database objects\n\nyou need to create a number of objects in the ripe database in order to fill in the ripe database template.\n\nplease follow the steps below in order to create them.\n\n 1. ripe ncc access account you need to have a ripe ncc access account in order to be able to use the web interface of the ripe database.\n    \n    you can create your ripe ncc access account using https://access.ripe.net/registration\n\n 2. role object and maintainer object each role objects describe a business function. each object has a unique nic handle as primary key.\n    \n    maintainer objects protect object in the ripe database. they contain the information needed to authorise creation, deletion or modification of the objects they protect.\n    \n    you can create your first role and maintainer objects using the object creation tool.\n    \n    choose a name for your maintainer object and enter it in the "mntner" field which will be the primary key.\n    \n    \n    \n    when you receive the message "your objects have been successfully created", make a note of your role object\'s primary key and mntner object\'s primary key.\n    \n    you can use your role object\'s primary key (nic handle) in the "admin-c:", "tech-c:" and "zone-c:" fields of the ripe database template.\n    \n    you can use yor mntner object\'s primary key in the "mnt-by:" field of the ripe database template.\n    \n    you can create additional person, role and mntner objects and also change the objects you already created using ripe database webupdates.\n\n 3. organisation object organisation objects contain information about organisations. each object has a unique organisation id ("organisation").\n    \n    you can create organisation object using ripe database webupdates\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    keep "auto-1" in the "organisation" field. the organisation id will be created automatically. enter the primary key of your mntner object in the "mnt-ref" field. use the "bell" icon to fill in the "abuse-c" field.\n    \n    \n    \n    when you receive this message: "your object has been successfully created". for example, "organisation org-xyz-ripe", make a note of the new organisation id (org-xyz-ripe).\n    \n    you can use the organisation id in the "org:" field.\n    \n    please note that organisation objects with iana, rir, nir or lir can only be created by the ripe ncc. any other entity must use other in the "org-type:" when creation organisation objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# accessing the object templates\n\nto create or modify an object you may need to access the template for that object. these are shown along with a detailed description of each attribute and its value in section 4. rpsl object types.\n\nfrom almost any computer, if you have a terminal window with a command line prompt, you can use either netcat (nc) or telnet commands to obtain any of the object templates. for this purpose, they both do the same job, but netcat is considered to have better error handling than telnet.\n\nfor example, getting the template for an inetnum object using these methods:\n\nusing netcat in a terminal window to obtain an object template:\n\n$ nc whois.ripe.net 43\n% this is the ripe database query

-v instead of -t in the above commands. once you have the template, it can be copied into an email message or pasted into a web form or added into a script to generate objects. to create an object from the template, you must remove all the attribute lines that you do not want. for the remaining lines, you must replace the description with the value. where an attribute is multiple, further lines can be added with additional values.\n\nwith some update methods the template is provided for you - for example, when using webupdates. if you select to create a new object using field mode it presents a set of fields matching all the mandatory attributes for the selected object type. optional attributes can be selected from a drop-down menu. more instances of any given attribute can be inserted. if you choose the text area mode, a list of all attributes is presented in the text area. the mandatory attributes are in upper case and the optional attributes are in lower case. delete the optional ones you don\'t want to use. the software later converts all attribute names to lower case.\n\nthe webupdates text area template can be used to present a template to be cut and pasted in another form or medium. the webupdates object creation process does not present the full template information. it only shows lists of attributes. to get the full template details, as shown in section 4. rpsl object types, use the web query form (by selecting the query option from webupdates) and enter the following query for the appropriate object type as the ‘search term\':\n\n-t inetnum\n\n\nusing -v instead of -t in the web query form will present the longer output describing all the attributes.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# dry-run\n\nthe test database has always been promoted as the place to "try" an update to see what happens. but the test database has very little data. it is also reset every 24 hours. so if you want to test anything that has dependencies on other data, you have to reproduce it all in the test database to do the test. that in itself can be a major effort. and tomorrow it is all gone.\n\nto address this, there is a "dry-run" feature that lets you test updates on the production ripe database. all your data is there with the correct authorisation tokens. all dependencies are taken care of. you can submit your update and see what the result would be, but nothing is actually changed in the database.\n\nto use the dry-run feature, submit an update by any available update method.\n\nenter whatever you want for this single object. use the correct syntax or include deliberate errors, full set of credentials or not - it all depends on what you want to test. somewhere in the update, enter the "dry-run:" pseudo-attribute on a new line:\n\ndry-run:\n\n\nit does not need a value. if you add any text it will be ignored. this pseudo-attribute can be added anywhere in the update message in the same way as the "password:" pseudo attribute can be. then submit the update.\n\nthe update is received by the ripe database production software. all the checks are done on the object:\n\n * syntax\n * business rules\n * authorisation\n * referential integrity\n\nthen it stops! nothing is changed in the ripe database.\n\nan acknowledgement message is returned to the user who submitted the update by the normal channels, depending on the input method used. no notifications are sent. so only the user who is testing the update gets the results. for a dry-run update that would modify an object, the diff output that would normally be in the notification message is added to the dry-run acknowledgement message. this helps to show what would be changed by an actual update. see the section on notifications for more details.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# format of the update message\n\nhistorically updates were only sent to the database using email messages. currently, there are many other methods of submitting update information to the database. however, we still refer to an update as an update message.\n\nthe different ways of submitting the update message are described in section email updates. the method that is used passes the data to an appropriate handler in the software. these handlers extract the one or more database objects from the update message along with any credentials, including passwords, pgp signatures and single sign-on session details. an object must start with one of the recognised object type attributes. these are described in section rpsl object types. the object ends with the first blank line found after the type attribute. this is technically defined as two consecutive new-line characters ("\\n\\n"). an object cannot contain a blank line. if a blank line is required for the visual representation of an object it must be either a "remarks:" attribute with no ‘value\' part or, if it is a continuation line of any attribute, it must start with a plus sign ("+"). see section split values for more details.\n\nwe apply a heuristic method to each paragraph of text in the update message to determine if it is an rpsl object. any part of the message that is not recognised as an rpsl object is ignored. these ignored parts are grouped together at the end of the acknowledgement message.\n\nthe object(s) presented in the update message must each match one of the object templates described in section rpsl object types. these templates can be accessed in several ways. see section accessing the object templates.\n\neach instance of an object must contain at least one of each of the mandatory attributes for that object type. the optional attributes can be left out, unless the software business rules require them. if any of the optional attributes are included they must have a ‘value\' part, unless the value is defined as free text. free text values can be blank. depending on the update method, one update message may contain several objects, with a mixture of creation, modification and deletion operations.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# garbage collection\n\nwhen specific objects of a certain type have existed in the database unreferenced for a continuous period of time, it becomes eligible for automatic deletion.\n\nthe object types include person, role, mntner, organisation (not if the type is lir) and key-cert. clusters of these objects that form a self-referencing group, without any reference from resource data, will also be deleted.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# historical data\n\nevery time an object is updated in the ripe database, the old version is saved. a standard query will always return the most recent version. the old versions are available by using the history query flags. see the section on querying historical data for more details. personal historical data is not available.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# object processing\n\nwhen an update message contains multiple objects, the order of processing the objects in the message only changes in specific situations. the database software tries to process the objects one by one, starting with the first recognised object in the message. the order can matter, however, the database software has limited options for changing the order. the only condition the software can recognise is when an auto-generation process is used for certain object primary keys. "auto-n" primary key values can be included for generation and can also be referenced by other objects in the same update message. these will be resolved, as long as the number "n" is consistent and there are no circular references. if an object that references a value ‘auto-1\' is listed in the update message before the object where the value ‘auto-1\' is generated, the ordering will be changed. the referencing object will be pushed to the end of the list, by which time the object crating the ‘auto-1\' value will have been processed.\n\nthe below figure shows an example of two objects that will be created but in a different order. the second figure shows an example of two objects that will not be created as there is a circular reference between the ‘auto-n\' attributes that can never be resolved. (only the relevant parts of the objects are shown in the figures.)\n\ninetnum:     193.0.7.35\nadmin-c:     auto-1\n\n\nperson:      admin guy\nnic-hdl:     auto-1\n\n\nin the example of the figure above. the second, person object must be created first. this gives a real value to ‘auto-1\'. then the first, inetnum object can be created referencing that real value for ‘auto-1\'.\n\norganisation:    auto-1\nadmin-c:         auto-2\n\n\nperson:          admin guy\nnic-hdl:         auto-2\norg:             auto-1\n\n\nin this figure, the object can be created because of the circular reference to ‘auto-n\' values. they both need to create a real value for an ‘auto-n\' tag. but they both reference the ‘auto-n\' tag of the other object, which does not yet exist.\n\nyou can avoid these complex arrangements of, and circular references to, auto-generated values in a single update message by sending multiple, consecutive updates instead.\n\nwhen processing each individual object, the software makes many checks including that:\n\n * the syntax of the object is correct.\n * the object passes all required authorisation checks.\n * all references to other objects can be resolved without conflicts.\n * the operation does not compromise referential integrity. for example, when an object is to be deleted, the server checks that it is not referenced from any other object in the ripe database.\n * the object complies with all software business rules, for example, not creating an allocation resource object without including the optional "org:" attribute. this is required in an allocation object.\n * the object complies with relevant policies, such as having the correct "status:" value in inetnum objects.\n\nif all checks are passed, the update will be successful for this object. if one of these checks fails, the operation fails for this object. this is shown in the acknowledgement message and sometimes in notification messages. see the section on notifications for more details.\n\neach object in the update message is processed independently of others (except for the ‘auto-n\' references). if the operation fails on one object, the following objects will still be processed. there may, however, be consequences of a previous failed operation. for example if a person object creation fails, a later object creation which references this person object will fail the referential integrity checks because the person object does not exist in the database.\n\nafter the software finishes processing all the objects in the update message, an acknowledgement message is returned to the sender of the original update. for email update messages, the acknowledgement will be another email sent to the address as specified in the "reply-to:" field or "from:" field. for synchronous update messages it will be returned via the open http connection. if the connection has timed out or been closed, no acknowledgement is sent. in all cases, the update will still be completed by the database software regardless of the status of http sessions of validity of email addresses. notification messages may also be sent. see the section on notifications for more information about this.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# special considerations for object creation\n\nmost object types follow the same rules when created. some object types have additional business rules that only apply to those types when they are created.\n\n\n# creating person and role objects\n\nto create person and role objects, you can either choose your own unique nic handle or you can use ‘auto-n\' where the server will automatically assign a nic handle.\n\nto request the server to assign a nic handle for you, specify the value of the "nic-hdl:" attribute as:\n\nnic-hdl: auto-<number>[<initials>]\n\nthe number is required. it does not form part of the nic handle but acts as an index. if your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this nic handle by the index. see the sub-section object processing for examples. the initials are optional. if you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the nic handle. otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "person:" or "role:" attribute. the syntax definition of a nic handle allows for an optional suffix at the end of the character string. the default suffix is "-ripe" when an ‘auto-n\' nic handle is used. if you want to use another suffix, or have no suffix, or you want to select the number part, then you must specify the full nic handle and not use the ‘auto-n\' option. please note that if you specify a nic handle that is currently in use, it may be considered as a modification operation, which may cause the operation to be refused depending on the update method used. see section 6.4 update operations for more details. if the operation continues, as a modification, it will usually result in an authentication error. if you select a nic handle that has previously been used and deleted, an error will be returned.\n\nif you are creating your first person or role object in the database, you must follow the procedure described in the sub-section \'new organisation startup\'.\n\n\n# reusing nic handles\n\nthe person and role objects are identified by nic handles. historically, these were available to reuse as soon as an object was deleted. many nic handles have been used and reused by several different people. as that can lead to confusion, the nic handles are no longer reusable. when a person or role object is created, the nic handle is added to a list of used nic handles. when the object is deleted the nic handle remains on the list. it can never be reused. please note that these objects cannot be deleted if they are referenced by any other object. this avoids accidental deletion of an object that is still in use. while some people try to create nic handles with a ‘"meaningful\'" name, it should be remembered that they are only meant as a database index. if you delete one that is unreferenced, then realise you still need it, you will need to create a new one.\n\n\n# creating organisation objects\n\nto create an organisation object, you must specify the id of the object as ‘auto-n\'. it is not possible to select the id yourself. it is always auto-generated.\n\norganisation: auto-<number>[<initials>].\n\nthe number is required. it does not form part of the id but acts as an index. if your update message contains multiple objects, other objects can reference this id by the index. see the sub-section \'object processing\' for examples. the initials are optional. if you choose to specify the <initials> (between two and four characters), they will be used to try to make the id. otherwise, the software will take the initials from the name in the "org-name:" attribute.\n\nfor example, if you want ‘ttr\' as the initials in the organisation id, you should put ‘auto-1ttr\' into the "organisation:" attribute, when you create the object. if you delete an organisation object you cannot recreate one with the same id as the one you deleted or with any other id that has been used previously.\n\n\n# new organisation startup (creating first objects)\n\nwhen you first use the ripe database, you need to create some basic objects. every object you create in the database must be maintained. that means you need a mntner object. this object must reference a role (or person) object as a contact. however, the role (or person) object must be maintained. therefore, a user cannot create either of these two objects first using any of the usual update methods.\n\nthere is separate page to create a role and maintainer pair, so that new users can get started.\n\nif errors occur during the creation process, these are reported back to the user. if successful, the mntner object name and the nic handle are returned to the user. there is no partial success allowed. if one object can be successfully created during the intermediate stage, but the second object has errors, no object will be created.\n\nif you have nothing in the ripe database, this startup script is the only way to get started. once you have this first pair of objects, you can use the normal update methods for all other objects.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# update operations\n\nthere are three update operations that can be performed on an object:\n\n * create\n * modify\n * delete\n\nthe create and modify share a lot in common. initially, when an object is presented by either email or syncupdates, the database software has to decide if the object already exists or not. if it exists, the operation is modify. if it does not exist the operation is create. this issue can be forced with the use of the keyword ‘new\'. if this keyword is included then the operation is set as create. if the object already exists, it will be an error. an existing object will never be updated when this keyword is included in the update. for email updates, this keyword will be in the ‘subject\' line. for client-based syncupdates this keyword is passed as a parameter. it is not possible to use the keyword with the web-based syncupdates form at: https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/syncupdates\n\nthe restful update method works differently as it follows the standard rest paradigm. if the data is received by a post method, the ‘new\' keyword is set and it can only be a create operation. if the data is received by a put method it can only be a modify operation. if the method and operation do not match it is an error.\n\nwebupdates uses the restful api as the update method. so it must also follow the rest paradigm. there are additional checks at the webupdates form level to ensure the right method is used.\n\nif the operation is modify and the supplied object data is identical to the existing object stored in the database, allowing for white space variations, then the object is not modified. this is considered to be a successful ‘no operation\'.\n\nthe delete operation is the same no matter what update method is used. the full version of the object must be supplied exactly as it is stored in the database. the supplied version is checked against the stored version by compressing the white spaces and doing a string comparison. if they don\'t match, the delete operation fails. if you query for the object before supplying the query result in a delete operation, make sure you use the correct query flags to avoid any filtering of the returned object. see section on filtering query output for more details.\n\nto delete an object, there must be no references to it from any other object in the database. a single reference will prevent it from being deleted. note, however, that not all attributes containing primary keys of other objects are hard references. the routing policy attributes in an aut-num object can list other as numbers but these are not considered as references for the delete operation.\n\nfor the restful api and also webupdates, the delete method is used. for mail and syncupdates the pseudo attribute "delete: some reason text" must be added to the object data. as these update methods allow multiple objects in an update message, this pseudo-attribute must be part of the object itself to ensure a strong association with this pseudo-attribute and a specific object. each object that is to be deleted must have a "delete:" pseudo attribute attached to it. it can be added at any point within the object or immediately before or after the object.\n\nobjects can still be deleted from the database even if they are not syntactically correct. this allows for old objects to be deleted long after the syntax has been changed. if the object was to be modified, any syntax errors would need to be corrected.\n\nfollowing acceptable use policy, we strive to detect potential attacks. if a dos attack is detected, we temporarily block the user\'s ip address.\n\nthe ripe database terms and conditions allow the ripe ncc to block or suspend access to the ripe database services for any suspected abuse. users exhibiting suspected abusive behavior may be permanently blocked from the system. if a user is permanently blocked, they will receive a notification informing them of the block whenever they attempt to make an update.\n\nif you wish to be unblocked, please contact the ripe database administration team ripe-dbm@ripe.net to discuss further.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# history of the ripe database\n\n * background of the ripe database\n * versions of the ripe database\n\n\n# background of the ripe database\n\nfrom the very first ripe meeting in 1989, the need for some sort of registry had been identified. in the early years of ripe, this consisted of documenting the use of ipv4 address space in the ripe region on a voluntary basis. the actual address space was not distributed by ripe.\n\nfrom august 1992, the newly established ripe ncc started distributing address space in its service region. allocations made by the ripe ncc have always been documented in the registry by the ripe ncc and the local internet registries (lirs). the ripe ncc address registry was set up to serve two purposes:\n\n 1. a comprehensive public record of the address space for which the ripe ncc has administrative responsibility. this concerns both address space allocated by the ripe ncc and address space allocated by others and transferred to the administrative responsibility of the ripe ncc.\n 2. a comprehensive public recording of the current holders of the address space. with the exhaustion of ipv4 address space, there will be no more unallocated ipv4 address space. however, the need for an accurate registry will remain.\n\ntransparency and accountability about the administration of internet number resources has always been very important. publication of the registry is an essential element of this transparency and accountability. the registry plays an important part in the operational coordination between internet operators. the internet routing registry (irr) was established in 1995. its purpose is to ensure stability and consistency of the internet-wide routing by sharing information between network operators.\n\noriginally, the ripe database was used by many domain name registries as their cctld authoritative registry database. for some of the larger cctld registries, the ripe database was not their authoritative database but held a lot of duplicated information from the domain registries. in some cases, it just held a top-level forward domain object and used a "refer:" attribute to re-direct any queries to their authoritative whois service. because this was a mixed up and incomplete system, it was decided at ripe 57 in october 2008 to remove all forward domain information from the ripe database. this was completed in january 2011.\n\n\n# versions of the ripe database\n\nthe original first version of the ripe database no longer exists and we have no information about it.\n\nthe second version of the ripe database was written in perl and used files to store the data rather than a database. the data was in the ripe-181 format. this version provided a clear separation of routing information from allocation details.\n\nversion 3 was released in april 2001. in this version, the old ripe database ripe-181 format was converted to the new rpsl format. the software was written in c and the data was stored in a mysql database.\n\nthe basic design of the data model is still the same now. since its release several years ago, many additional features have been added. new object types were added in 2004, including the organisation object. when the ripe ncc started to encourage the adoption of ipv6, theripe database software was made fully compliant with ipv6 and additional object types were added for this: inet6num and route6.\n\nweb forms were introduced for both queries and updates shortly after this version was released. these have been constantly revised over the years and are still subject to regular minor improvements and occasional major improvement.\n\na restful api was introduced, which was deployed to production in 2013.\n\nthe software underwent a major re-factor, still in c, in 2004. it was totally rewritten in java in 2012, for queries, and early 2013- for updates. the database backend was switched from mysql to mariadb in 2016.\n\nthis database software is also used, with some local modifications, by apnic and afrinic.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# personal data, database management and responsibilities\n\n * personal data in the ripe database\n * database management\n * responsibilities of the ripe ncc and data maintainers\n\n\n# personal data in the ripe database\n\nthe ripe ncc provides the software and the hardware infrastructure to operate the ripe database service. the ripe ncc also provides 24/7 monitoring and engineering support to maximise reliability, availability and performance. there is a customer support service to provide assistance to those using the ripe database.\n\nmost personal data is not registered in the ripe database by the ripe ncc but by others (generally, those responsible for the specific internet number resources or by the data subjects themselves). the ripe ncc has only limited, control (and in some cases, no control) over the personal data stored in the ripe database. the purpose and means of processing personal data registered in the ripe database are not determined by the ripe ncc but by the ripe community. however, the ripe ncc is the organisation that implements and/or oversees the implementation of instructions given by the ripe community. in that sense, the ripe ncc could be seen as the responsible party for processing personal data in the ripe database in accordance with the dutch data protection act.\n\nsteps are taken to prevent bulk access to personal data and limits exist on how many personal data objects can be queried in a 24-hour period. in some situations, the data made available in some forms is dummified. this is a process by which information that could identify a person or organisation is removed from the output.\n\nanyone whose personal details have been entered into the public ripe database should have been informed by the person/organisation that entered those details. if you find your personal details within the ripe database and you had no knowledge of this, you should, firstly, raise this issue with the person/organisation that entered those details. you may find it is a condition of a contract that provides your internet services, but you had not realised it.\n\nif you want these details corrected or completely removed from the ripe database you should again, in the first instance, contact that same person/organisation that maintains this data in the ripe database. if they do not comply with your request to your satisfaction, the ripe ncc has a procedure for the removal of personal contact details from the ripe database. you must realise that the consequences of removing such data may result in the cancellation of some services. that is a matter you must take up with the service provider.\n\nfor more information regarding personal data in the ripe database, please refer to the ripe ncc data protection report where more information can be found about the processing of personal data and the applicable legal framework.\n\n\n# database management\n\nthe ripe ncc is tasked by the ripe community to manage the ripe database as a public service. although the ripe ncc has limited control over the personal data registered in the ripe database and is not responsible for all of the operational data content, there are occasions when the ripe ncc may correct or delete ripe database data:\n\n * according to accepted ripe policy proposals/ripe documents\n * to comply with applicable law\n * if so ordered by any competent court\n * to fulfil any legal obligation\n * when a breach of the terms and conditions has occurred\n * for management operations of the ripe database\n * if data is inaccurate\n * if data has been entered by someone who is not authorised to do so\n * if an individual has requested the removal of their personal data\n\nthis list may change over time and is not exhaustive. for further details please refer to the terms and conditions.\n\n\n# responsibilities of the ripe ncc and data maintainers\n\nin terms of managing the ripe database public service, there are some things the ripe ncc is and is not responsible for.\n\n * the ripe ncc does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness or availability of the ripe database or of the data contained therein.\n * the maintainer is responsible for keeping all data maintained by them accurate and up-to-date, including correct contact details. the data must be good enough to allow the ripe ncc to contact the maintainer or registrant within a reasonable time without having to get information from another source.\n * the maintainer who enters personal data into the ripe database has a responsibility to inform the individual to whom the data pertains and to obtain his/her explicit consent for the entry in the public ripe database if required by law.\n * the ripe ncc is not responsible for the use of any registered internet number resources nor is the ripe ncc responsible for any issues that may arise from this use.\n * the ripe ncc is not responsible for any issues arising from the use of any information contained within the public ripe database.\n\nthis list may change over time and is not exhaustive. for further details please refer to the terms and conditions.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n# purpose and content of the ripe database\n\nthe ripe ncc has been tasked by the ripe community to maintain a database of internet resource information. some of this information is confidential between the ripe ncc and the resource holder and some of it is publicly available. the ripe network management database, more often referred to as the ripe database, provides the public view of this data. some of the management details for maintaining internet resources in this database are also confidential, for example md5 password hashes. the ripe database provides access to this private data for resource holders.\n\nthe ripe database holds data for three separate registries:\n\n * ripe internet number registry (ripe inr)\n * ripe internet routing registry (ripe irr)\n * reverse delegation and enum registry\n\nthese could be three independent databases, however the information in each of them is related to each other. it was therefore decided to integrate the three registries into one logical database. in practise, it is also one physical database.\n\n\n# purpose of the ripe database\n\nthe ripe database contains information for the following purposes:\n\n * ensuring the uniqueness of internet number resource usage through registration of information related to the resources and their registrants and maintainers (ripe inr)\n * to provide accurate registration information of these resources in order to meet a variety of operational requirements\n * publishing routing policies by network operators (ripe irr)\n * facilitating coordination between network operators (network problem resolution, outage notification etc.)\n * provisioning of reverse domain name system (dns) and enum delegations\n * scientific research into network operations and topology\n * providing information to parties involved in disputes over internet number resource registrations to parties who are legally authorised to receive such information.\n\n\n# ripe internet number registry\n\nglobal internet resources are allocated by the internet assigned numbers authority (iana) to five regional internet registries (rirs). the ripe internet number registry (ripe inr) contains details of the internet resources managed by the ripe ncc within the ripe ncc service region. these details in the ripe database are maintained jointly by the ripe ncc and the registrants of those resources. the ripe inr also contains details of sub-allocations and assignments made from these resources by the registrants. this information is maintained in the ripe database by the registrants of those resources.\n\nthe information includes the organisations that hold the resources, where the allocations were made, and contact details for the networks. dates of when changes were made to this information are also included, and some of the historical information is also available.\n\n\n# the ripe internet routing registry\n\nthe ripe internet routing registry (irr) is part of a global distribution of databases by which network operators can publish their routing policies and their routing announcements so that other network operators can make use of the data. in addition to making internet topology visible, the irr is used by network operators to look up peering agreements, determine optimal policies, and more recently, to configure their routers.\n\neach rir has its own irr. there are also many independent irrs, for example radb. a resource holder can register their routing information in any of the irr databases. most of the larger irrs mirror each others\' routing information. therefore, it is only necessary to enter this information into one irr.\n\nonly resources allocated to the ripe region can be registered in the ripe irr.\n\nthe benefits of the irr are only realised when registered routing policies are kept up-to-date, and reflect routing announcements in the \'real world\'.\n\n\n# reverse delegation\n\n\n# what is reverse delegation?\n\nthe domain name system (dns) is a globally distributed internet service. it provides name-to-number (forward) and number-to-name (reverse) translations, using defined client-server and server-server protocols. the dns is a public service - any internet user is freely able to query the dns system for forward or reverse translations.\n\nreverse dns delegations allow applications to map to a domain name from an ip address. reverse delegation is achieved by use of the special domain names in-addr.arpa (ipv4) and ip6.arpa (ipv6).\n\nfor all ip address blocks that iana allocates to the ripe ncc, they also delegate the corresponding reverse dns zones within the centrally administered \'in-addr.arpa\' and \'ip6.arpa\' zones.\n\nthe ripe ncc also publishes \'zone fragments\'. these are the parts of zones managed by other parties - the other regional internet registries (rirs), who share zone management of early registration networks.\n\n\n# reverse delegation in the ripe database\n\nthe ripe database is used as the management database to produce the dns zones ripe internet number resources. it can provide the information for each delegated ipv4 and ipv6 range registered in the reverse dns.\n\nthe information is stored in routing policy specification (rpsl) format as domain objects. the name of each domain object is the reverse dns zone under in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa or e164.arpa. the "nserver:" attributes in each domain object define the officially delegated dns name servers- the “ns” in dns zone contents.\n\n\n# domain names\n\nthe ripe database used to contain information about domain names for top level domain registries based in the ripe ncc service region as well as a few other regions. these were all removed from the ripe database by the end of 2011. the ripe database now contains no information about forward domain names. further information about domain names can be found on the iana cctld web page.\n\n\n# administration of internet resources\n\niana is responsible for ensuring the uniqueness of the full set of internet resources. this includes the full range of ipv4 and ipv6 addresses and the whole 32-bit autonomous system (as) number range. iana allocates blocks of these resources to each of the five rirs for them to distribute to their members and end users.\n\nthe ripe database contains large placeholder allocation objects to represent the range of ipv4 and ipv6 addresses that have been allocated by iana to the ripe ncc. not all of this address space has been allocated yet by the ripe ncc to lirs or end users.\n\nthe ripe database also holds details of legacy internet resources. "legacy" is the term given to those internet number resources that were distributed before (or outside of) the current system of hierarchical distribution by the regional internet registries (rirs). legacy internet resources were transferred to the ripe ncc from the iana\'s central registry according to the location of their legal organisation contact at the time.\n\nlegacy address space represented in the ripe database is structured into an administrative hierarchy. for every legacy hierarchy in the ripe database there is one inetnum that sits at the top of the hierarchy. the ripe ncc considers the holder of this inetnum as the top-level legacy resource holder. all more specifics to this object are considered to have some business or contractual or historical relationship with the top-level legacy resource holder.\n\nit is intended that the ripe database must only hold information about ip addresses that the ripe ncc is administratively responsible for. there may still be some historical data that needs cleaning up.\n\nthe full range of 32-bit as numbers are represented in the ripe database by the as-block objects. all asns assigned by the ripe ncc are represented in the ripe database by aut-num objects.\n\nit should be noted that the ripe database is part of the global internet routing registry. it may contain route(6) objects relating to any address space. this does not indicate any authoritative or administrative control over these internet resources by the ripe ncc.\n\nthere is a link between the number registry and the routing registry in order to authorise the creation of these route(6) objects. as a result, the originating asn must be represented in the ripe database. because of this requirement, many aut-num objects have been created in the ripe database that are copies of asns that the ripe ncc is not administratively responsible for. this can sometimes cause confusion when the copied aut-num object in the ripe database reflects different contact details or routing policy to the object held in the database of the authoritative rir.\n\n\n# mirrored databases\n\nthe ripe global resource service (grs) provides resource information mirrored from several other databases. these are held in physically separate databases but logically part of the ripe database service. they can be queried using several of the ripe database interfaces. the information is updated daily from the authoritative source.\n\nthe following databases are mirrored:\n\n * afrinic\n * apnic\n * arin\n * jpirr\n * lacnic\n * radb\n * (ripe grs)\n\nto view the up-to-date list of mirrored databases, perform the following query:\n\nwhois.ripe.net -q sources\n\n\nbecause the ripe ncc is bound by dutch and european data privacy laws, we are obligated to remove all personal data received from other databases. this is either removed at the source or stripped out and deleted during the transformation process. the ripe ncc does not store any personal data from other registries. where necessary, we create and reference dummy objects to keep data integrity intact.\n\nbefore importing the data we transform objects into ripe rpsl syntax by carrying out the following steps:\n\n * adding missing mandatory attributes\n * wrapping unrecognised attributes with "remarks"\n * creating dummy objects for missing data to keep referential integrity\n * converting attributes values\n * all these transformations are marked by "end of line" comments in the objects\n\nto use grs from the web interface, select the appropriate radio button below the search box. when using telnet or the whois command line client, add the --resource flag to your query to query only the dummified grs databases, or the -a flag to query all available databases, i.e. grs sources and the original ripe database combined.\n\n\n\nusing the api, you can specify one or multiple grs source names as parameters, e.g. "source=arin-grs" or "source=arin-grs&source=apnic-grs". for more information, please refer to the documentation on github.\n\n\n# criteria for a mirrored database\n\ndatabases mirrored by the ripe ncc must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nthe mirrored database must be:\n\n * public\n * large\n * useful to users in the ripe ncc service region\n\nthe ripe ncc reserves the final judgement on mirroring a database. you can request the ripe ncc to mirror a database by contacting us.\n\n\n# i want to change something in the ripe database\n\nchanges can be proposed to the ripe database purpose and content by anyone from the ripe community using the ripe policy development process.\n\n\n# terms and conditions\n\nthe legal statement of what the ripe database is, and how it can be used is defined in the ripe database terms and conditions. while the information in the ripe database is made freely available to the public, it is all subject to these terms and conditions.\n\n----------------------------------------',charsets:{cyrillic:!0,cjk:!0}}],themeConfig:{nav:[],sidebar:["",{title:"Introduction to the RIPE
