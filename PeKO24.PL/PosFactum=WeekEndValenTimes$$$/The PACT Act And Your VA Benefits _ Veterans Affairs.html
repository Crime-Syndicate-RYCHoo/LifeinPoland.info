If you want to get one sooner, contact your local VA health facility. Ask to get screened by the toxic exposure screening navigator.</p><p>You can also schedule a telehealth screening on our VET-HOME website.&#xA0;<br><a href='https://vethome.va.gov/'>Learn more about toxic exposure screenings on our VET-HOME website</a></p></body></html>"

              <p>The PACT Act is a law that expands VA health care and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances. This law helps us provide generations of Veterans&#x2014;and their <a href="https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/#information-for-survivors">survivors</a>&#x2014;with the care and benefits they&#x2019;ve earned and deserve. And starting<strong> March 5, 2024</strong>, we&#x2019;re expanding VA health care to millions of Veterans&#x2014;years earlier than called for by the PACT Act.&#xA0;</p>
<p>This page will help answer your questions about what the PACT Act means for you or your loved ones.

      <p>The PACT Act is perhaps the largest health care and benefit expansion in VA history. The full name of the law is&#xA0;The Sergeant First Class (SFC) Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act.</p>
<p><strong>The PACT Act will bring these changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expands and extends eligibility for&#xA0;VA health care for Veterans with toxic exposures and Veterans of the&#xA0;Vietnam, Gulf War,&#xA0;and post-9/11 eras</li>
<li>Adds 20+ more&#xA0;presumptive conditions for&#xA0;burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic exposures</li>
<li>Adds more&#xA0;presumptive-exposure locations for Agent Orange and radiation</li>
<li>Requires VA to provide a&#xA0;toxic exposure screening&#xA0;to every Veteran enrolled in VA health care</li>
<li>Helps us improve research, staff education, and treatment related to toxic exposures</li>

      <p>To get a VA disability rating, your disability must connect to your military service. For many health conditions, you need to prove that your service caused your condition.&#xA0;</p>

<p>The screening will ask you if you think you were exposed to any of these hazards while serving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open burn pits and other&#xA0;airborne hazards</li>
<li>Gulf War-related exposures</li>
<li>Agent Orange</li>

<li>Camp Lejeune contaminated water exposure</li>

<p>We&#x2019;ll then give you information about any benefits, registry exams, and clinical resources you may need.</p>
<p>Ask about the screening at your next VA health care appointment. If you want to get one sooner, contact your local VA health facility. Ask to get screened by the toxic exposure screening navigator.</p>
